            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Shall not need (Right Honourable) to ſpend much time and many words in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Booke to your Lordſhip, and all ſincere Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Gods truth, ſeeing the name of the Author, ſurmounting my beſt
<pb facs="tcp:18580:3"/>praiſes, can much better grace it to them (and many were they) that knew him; and the worke it ſelfe may worthily commend the Author to them that knew him not. Jt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth unto your Lordſhip the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Lectures of that faithfull Servant of God, and famous Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpell, Doctor <hi>Sutton,</hi> in his weekly exerciſe at <hi>S. Marie Overies</hi> in Southwarke, which when they were delivered, were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the generall applauſe and approbation of all his Hearers, that were godly and judicious A man furniſhed with many rich endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and entruſted by our great Lord and Maſter with not a few of his choyceſt talents, which, whileſt he lived, hee employed faithfully and fruitfully, to the glorie of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:18580:3"/>the edification of his people in his painfull Miniſterie. But (alas) too little a while did this burning and ſhining light appeare unto the world, ſetting in our Horizon, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Poeticall fiction) dying in the Ocean by an unnaturall motion, before he had attained unto the high noone of his perfection, that he might ſhine much more cleerely among thoſe bright Stars, who with him have been the meanes upon earth of enlightning and converting many others. Some little glympſe hath hee left behind him of his greater light (like the rayes in the skie after the Sun ſetting) in theſe his labours penned by his owne hand, for his owne uſe: which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the gracefulneſſe of his elocution, and powerfull ſpirit to enlive them, in which he excelled; are but like a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:18580:4"/>body ſtripped of its ornaments, or a dead picture compared to a living body: and this picture as farre ſhort in beautie and likeneſſe of that it would have beene, if himſelfe had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to perfect it with his owne penſill, as a picture taken of a dead man in compariſon of one which is drawen to the life. But yet I ſuppoſed, that this dimmer candle-light of his fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labours, was too uſefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to lye any longer hid under a buſhell, and that it was in me a kinde of ſacrilege, to rob the Church of the uſe of his talents after hee had done trading with them, and to hide them in a manuſcript (as it were in a nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin) which being publiſhed might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come profitable for the inriching of many.</p>
            <p>And therefore that God might be
<pb facs="tcp:18580:4"/>yet more glorified by theſe fruitfull labours of his faithfull ſervant, and the Church thereby might be alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edified, J have cauſed them, by being imprinted, to be laid out in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for the benefit of many, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who having beene his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie hearers, were much addicted to his Miniſterie, and will highly eſteem the worke for the Authors ſake.</p>
            <p>The which I humbly preſent and dedicate to your Honors Patronage, being emboldened hereunto by your fervent love to Gods truth, and your zealous profeſsion of it in theſe cold and declining times: as alſo for that honourable reſpect which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in your Lordſhip to Gods poore Miniſters, and your cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiving of them and their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, for their Maſters ſake: and

The Lord more and more multiply all his graces in you, that you may long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, as a Noble Peere of our Common-wealth, ſo a firme Pillar of our Church, adorning your religion, which as your beſt ornament chiefly adorneth you, and gracing that truth by your holy profeſsion and practice, which above all other titles will moſt enoble you, and make you truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in this world, in the ſight of God and all good men, and eternize

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no ſmall part of mans miſerie, that being created by God in a ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and immortalitie, hee hath made himſelfe mortall by his ſinne and fall. And it is an evidence of Gods infinite and never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admired mercie, that hee hath not onely by the death of his beſt beloved Sonne, reſtored all his elect to a ſtate of incorruption, and eternall life, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſedneſſe in the world to come, but alſo in this world hath provided certaine meanes and medicines, for the curing, in ſome ſort, even of death and mortalitie it ſelfe, which in their owne nature are apt to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie us all in perpetuall oblivion. Namely, that whereas by Gods juſt &amp; unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentence we muſt all dye, yet by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we propagate our kinde, and ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:18580:7"/>though mortall in our ſelves, wee are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalized in our poſteritie. Beſides which benefit, common to all mankinde, God vouchſafeth a more peculiar bleſſing unto thoſe whom he calleth to be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fathers in the Church, begetting chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God by the ſeed of the Word, and preſerving them in this life of grace by their fruitfull and powerfull preaching of the Goſpell. Eſpecially if hee alſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth them to leave unto their children the riches of their holy writings for their inſtruction, and increaſing of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall growth, in all grace and goodneſſe, as it were holy legacies bequeathed by their laſt will and teſtament. For thoſe ſpirituall births of the braine are herein much to bee preferred before the fruit of the wombe, in that they continue an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable memorie of their Father after his death, whereas the other often dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating from the vertues of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, doe ſtaine their names with their vices and diſhonourable actions. But much more doth God honour thoſe who
<pb facs="tcp:18580:7"/>thus honour him, in giving them power to ſpeake unto his people, even when their bodies rot in the grave, and making them inſtruments of his glorie, and of much good vnto his children, even for a long time after death. So that as wicked men doe not onely whileſt they live, by their ſinnes treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and prepare a fire in which they ſhall everlaſtingly be burned, but alſo by propagating their ſinnes unto poſteritie, and leaving behinde them the example of their vices, whereby others daily are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively corrupted, doe adde fuell to that helliſh fire, and increaſe their never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding torments: So Gods ſervants, even after they are dead, have ſtill a ſtocke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when as they leave behinde them their Chriſtian vertues for examples, and their holy writings, teaching and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others to follow them, whereby a daily addition is made to their glorie and happineſſe. Such legacies after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath this reverend and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt left for the uſe and benefit
<pb facs="tcp:18580:8"/>of the Church, and ſuch children to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate his name and memorie unto all poſteritie, I meane the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of many his learned Sermons, which he preached in his place &amp; charge, at <hi>S. Marie Overies</hi> in Southwarke, to the great benefit, comfort, and contenment of thoſe that heard him. The which though he had not poliſhed and perfected for the Preſſe, (as he might have done if it had pleaſed God to have prolonged his life) yet I thought it not fit that they ſhould alwaies be hidden from the world, becauſe they had not on them their beſt apparrell. They were, I aſſure thee, his owne legitimate children, conceived and bred in his owne braine, which were thus farre fitted for their birth, and prepared for the Preſſe, though himſelfe wanted life and ſtrength to bring them forth. Eſteeme them not the leſſe becauſe they are Orphans, but entertaine them rather with the more love; and if thou findeſt in them any defects and wants, pitie them the more, becauſe they have loſt their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:18580:8"/>who would (had he lived) have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them: and eſteeme them both in their own worth, and alſo for their fathers ſake. And if I finde that thou giveſt this kinde entertainment, to theſe his fruitfull labours, as it were, his firſt borne; there are divers other children of the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſhall ere long bee brought to light; I meane his Lectures on the twelfth Chapter to the Romans, and on a great part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The parts are five. 1. A conſolation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Iewes,<note place="margin">Analyſis.</note> that notwithſtanding God had caſt them off, yet ſuch a remnant of them as were within the covenant of election, ſhould be ſaved through grace, from the firſt verſe to the ſeventh. 2.

The happy product and event that will follow this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Iewes, and this calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; And this is double, the one, <hi>Salus Gentium;</hi> i. <hi>The ſalvation of the Gentiles, verſ.</hi> 11. The other in the ſame place, <hi>Vt Iudaei converſione Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium ad zelum provocati, reſipiſoant.</hi> i. <hi>That the Iewes being provoked to jealouſie by the converſion of the Gentiles, ſhall repent.</hi> The which is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by circumſtances, to the ſeventeenth. 4. An exhortation to the Gentiles, that they wex not proud, nor inſult over the Iewes. Firſt, becauſe they may bee caſt off againe, if they ſtand not conſtant in the faith. Secondly, becauſe the Iewes ſhall againe be called home before the end of the world, as <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. this is from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth verſe to the three and thirtieth. 5. A concluſion of his diſputation, containing an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and aſtoniſhment of <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſee the deepneſſe (or rather, becauſe hee cannot ſee the deepneſſe) of Gods wiſdome in the ordering and

If he doe none of theſe, hee ſhall finde the love of many burning Profeſſors as cold as ſnow water. They wil many times reward the Prophets, but not in the name of a Prophet, but becauſe they are built up in their itching qualitie.

If you love the Miniſters truly, bleſſed are yee, for then you love Chriſt that ſends them, then you have ſurely got ſome wisdome by them, then you take pleaſure and joy in hearing them, then you eſteeme them as men ſet over you by God to doe you good.

               <p>The laſt evident token,<note place="margin">The laſt ſigne of our election.</note> that a man is ſure of ſalvation, is an earneſt longing for Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to judgement, when a man cries with the Spouſe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come

When we are the Spouſe of Chriſt, then we long for the comming of the Bridegroome; if we be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incoporate into Chriſt, then wee long to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.

The worke is, to heare the Lord, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times threatning in the Law, ſometimes wooing and perſwading in the Goſpell, ſometimes to be praying unto him, ſometimes to be praiſing him, ſometimes to bee feeding him in his ſervants, ſometimes cloathing him in his members, to have our whole converſation with him. It is the repairing of Gods image in us, and the quieting of thoſe clamorous conſciences, that will never be friends with us, till we be friends with God. 2. The reward, is bleſſing; Bleſſing ſhall cover the head of the righteous, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.6. Bleſſed in the things of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.20. For the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

Bleſſed in his name, for the memoriall of the juſt is bleſſed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.7. yet if hee ſhould have none of theſe, the glorie hereafter would recompence all: for if either life, or glorie, or kingdome, or inheritance will doe it, they ſhall have it in abundance. What ſo much to be deſired as life? What life ſo much as the life of glorie? <hi>The faithfull behold the image of the Lord with open face, as in a myrrour, and are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image from glorie to glorie,</hi> from this to eternall glorie, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. So that when you have named the higheſt titles of honour and majeſty, you may ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 149.9. <hi>Such honour have all his Saints.</hi> Or as <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when hee had upon him the royall apparrell, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6.9. I adde but one word more. God is ſo ſtrong with them, that hee will have great ones to eſteeme them above their greateſt favourites, as <hi>Zereſh</hi> told <hi>Haman; If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the Iewes, before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevaile, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him, Eſth.</hi> 6.13. To bee the ſonnes of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is nothing to the ſonnes of God; to bee borne of Princes is but baſeneſſe, in compariſon of this, to be borne of God: <hi>Moab is but a waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, Edom but a wiper of ſhooes, Pſal.</hi> 108.9.</p>

But eternally he caſts off none, but ſuch as were of old ordained to condemnation; for this fore-knowledge, ſome ſay, was of them whom he fore-knew to bee apt to receive faith, but this was the errour of the Greekes, attributing too much unto mans free will, and was much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> For it is thus ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord ſet his love upon you, not becauſe you were many, but becauſe he loved you freely;</hi> That is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cauſe in you. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> underſtands it comparatively, hee fore-knew them before the Gentiles, that is, to bee called before the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: But as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerves, here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of calling, but of eternall predeſtination.

               <p>God hee conceives all things at once with one act of his underſtanding,<note place="margin">2. Of the order of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to which all things both paſt and to come are preſent, and as hee conceived, ſo hee decreed all things at once: but the reaſonable creature being finite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives one thing after another. Therefore for our underſtandings wee may diſtinguiſh the counſell of God concerning man into two acts, or two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18580:41"/>degrees. 1. The purpoſe of God in himſelfe, in which he determines what hee will doe, and the end of all his doings, and that is to create all things, ſpecially man for his owne glorie, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.7. partly by ſhewing mercie on ſome, and partly by ſhewing of his juſtice upon others. 2. Is another purpoſe, whereby hee decrees the execution of the former, and laves downe meanes to accompliſh the end thereof, which two acts of the counſell of God are not to be ſevered, nor yet confounded, but diſtinctly conſidered with ſome difference; for in the firſt God decrees ſome men to honour by ſhewing mercie, and ſome to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour by ſhewing his juſtice upon them, and this man more than that out of his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that is the onely cauſe that we can give, even his will. In the ſecond are ſet downe the cauſes of the execution of the former decree, and theſe are knowen, and manifeſt: for no man though left out of clection, is condemned but for ſinne, no man though elected is yet ſaved, but by the merits of Chriſt: But I paſſe over this, and come to the parts of predeſtination, which are two.</p>
               <p>The parts of Gods predeſtination are two.<note place="margin">3. The parts of predeſtination.</note> The firſt, the decree of election.

               <p>Howſoever Gods will be the reaſon whereinto all cauſes muſt be reſolved, and end in that, yet ſome imes there may bee given a reaſon of Gods will, yet that reaſon muſt not be called an effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of Gods will. The reaſon why God placed <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, was that hee might dreſſe it and keepe it; the reaſon why God drove not the Canaanite out of the land, was becauſe <hi>the wickedneſſe of the Amorites was not yet full, Gen.</hi> 15.16. The reaſon why God brought Iſrael
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18580:43"/>thorow the deſart, rather than <hi>per compendia,</hi> by more compendious and neerer wayes, was, that they might not eaſily bee met by their enemies. Yet then onely muſt a reaſon of his will be given, when he himſelfe hath given it in his Word.<note place="margin">Of the finall cauſes of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> For the finall cauſes of predeſtination they are plainly ſet downe by <hi>Paul,</hi> eſpecially citing that of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Rom.</hi> 9.17. <hi>For this ſame cauſe have I ſtirred thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be glorified thorowout all the earth, or for this verie cauſe have I appointed thee,</hi> as it is, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. And of the elect hee ſaith, it was <hi>that God might ſhew the riches of his glorie upon the veſſells of mercie, Rom.</hi> 9.23. and as there is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo there may be a materiall cauſe. Men who are predeſtinated, and the benefits which God beſtowes on the elect, vocation, juſtification, ſanctification, glorie: But the queſtion is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cauſe impulſive, whether it were his meere will, or his fore-ſeene faith and workes. That faith and workes be,<note place="margin">Of the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe of election.</note> was the Tenent of the old Pelagians, renewed in latter times by ſome counterfeit Lutherans, at the firſt maintaining faith ſimply to be the cauſe of election, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward onely the inſtrumentall, and not the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of election; See the Rhemiſts <hi>In Annotat. in Rom.</hi> 9. Obſerve then, 1. what wee hold: 2. our arguments: 3. the oppoſition of the adverſarie.</p>
               <p>In the decree of election there is a double act. The firſt concernes the end. The ſecond the means. I ground this propoſition upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18580:43"/>
                  <hi>That the purpoſe according to election might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> where I ſee firſt in Gods decree an electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before the purpoſe of damning, or ſaving. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. &amp; 30. Thoſe whom hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew he did predeſtinate to be made like to the image of his Sonne, and <hi>whom hee predeſtinated, them</hi> &amp;c. where there is a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the decree, <hi>viz.</hi> predeſtination, and the execution of his decree, which conſiſts in theſe three. 1. Vocation. 2. Iuſtification. 3. Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The firſt act I call a part of Gods divine purpoſe, whereby hee bringeth ſome men into love and favour, paſſing by the reſt, and makes them veſſels of honour, and theſe are the acts of the ſole will of God, without all reſpect to either good or evill in the creature. Neither doth God wrong any, though he chuſe not all, becauſe hee is tied to none; as a man having no childe of his owne, and ſeeing a multitude of beggers, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one of them, and leaveth out the reſt, though hee ſhew mercie on him whom hee adopts, yet doth no wrong to the reſt; ſo is it with God. The ſecond act is a purpoſe of ſaving, or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring glorie, and this hath no other impulſive cauſe than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the good pleaſure of God, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Hee hath predeſtinare us to bee adopted through Ieſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will;</hi> where note that this purpoſe of ſaving, is with regard to Chriſt the Mediator, who was firſt ordained to be a Mediator between God and man, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Hee was ordained before the foundation of the world.</hi> Secondly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed

               <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond part of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Of reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the cauſes of it.</note> which makes the greater doubt, whether reprobation have any other impulſive cauſe or reaſon, beſides the pleaſure and will of God: that is, whether their fore-ſeene infidelitie and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie in ſinne, did move God to reprobate any.</p>
               <p>This latter, that it was for ſinne, was anciently maintained by the Pelagians, as may appeare by S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> diſputations againſt them: in latter times by <hi>Stapleton, Antidot. in Epiſt. ad Rom.</hi> onely of purpoſe to contradict <hi>Calvin:</hi> his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be, 1.

From the Apoſtles words, <hi>whom he will he hardeneth:</hi> God hardeneth none but ſuch as have an ill will already, for which hee hardeneth them. 3. From thoſe

Vpon thoſe words, <hi>God being willing to ſhew his anger;</hi> now God ſhewes his anger againſt nothing but ſinne; and therefore did fore-ſee ſinne which moved him to anger. 5. The Apoſtle makes the cauſe why God did caſt off the Iewes, to bee partly their pride and vaine boaſting of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Iſrael which followed the Law of righteouſneſſe could not attaine to the Law of righteouſneſſe;</hi> partly their incredulitie, <hi>through unbeleefe they are caſt off, Rom.</hi> 11.20. and theſe doe ſhew that the ſins of everie reprobate are to God a cauſe lawfully moving him, why he doth abſolutely reprobate him.</p>
               <p>On the contrarie, <hi>Calvin</hi> in that excellent book of predeſtination confuting <hi>Pighius,</hi> cites that of the hating of <hi>Eſau</hi> to prove that it was not for ſin. 2. That in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>He hath mercie on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth;</hi> therefore his will is the onely cauſe of mercie and induration. 3.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18580:47"/>other, whom I am content to follow, till I ſee a ſounder than he.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to hold,<note place="margin">The cauſes of reprobation ſpoken of in the Scriptures two wayes.</note> that the Scriptures ſpeak of the judgements of God, and of the cauſes of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and reprobation two wayes: 1. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that abſolute power which God hath over man and all creatures, and then aſcribes the cauſe of all to his good will &amp; pleaſure. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I am he that for me the light and create darkneſſe, I make peace and create evill,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>He worketh all things according to the counſell of his will.</hi> 2. According to that ordinate right, that is the rule of diſtributive juſtice revealed in the Law and in the Goſpell; to which Law God doth (as it were) ſubmit himſelfe, and according to that which is there revealed, he would have us to thinke of his judgements, and ſo the cauſe is to be referred partly to Gods will, partly to mans ſin. As <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ye ſhall keepe my ſtatutes, which if a man doe, he ſhall live in them.</hi> And <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die.

               <p n="1">1. If wee ſpeake of Gods abſolute juſtice and right, the cauſe of both, election and reprobation is the ſole will of God.

                  </note> and ſhall any dare to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with God in the ſame? 2.

Where I finde that nothing deſerves anger but ſinne, and God by damning ſuch doth both prove himſelfe to bee a juſt Iudge, and takes away all cauſe of complaint from damned reprobates, who run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their owne damnation by their owne ſinnes, and ſo acquit God of it. But to make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine plaine, give me leave to premiſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and I will ſet downe my judgement in foure concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">A two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> There is a two-fold reprobation, eternall, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods counſell eternall to reprobate thoſe whom hee doth actually reprobate in time. Of this ſpeakes <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Veſſels prepared to deſtruction.</hi> And <hi>Iude, verſ.</hi> 4. Temporall, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifeſtation of his eternall counſell, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probating thoſe in time, whom he decreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate from eternitie. Of this God ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. 2. Reprobation hath two
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18580:48"/>acts, the one negative, <hi>will not ſhew mercie.</hi> The other affirmative, <hi>will condemne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> The one called the decree of not ſhewing mercie; the other the decree of puniſhing: each of them hath two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The negative hath firſt the negation of the meanes, or of grace. Secondly, the negation of the end and glorie. The affirmative hath 1. a juſt hardening. 2. An appointing to the puniſhment. The 3. premiſe is this: Reprobates may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, either ſimply in themſelves, or compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with the elect; whence come three que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. 1. Why did God reprobate any at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely. 2. Why this or that man definitely. 3. Why this man rather than that, <hi>Eſau</hi> rather than <hi>Iacob,</hi> comparatively. Theſe things being thus premiſed, I come to the concluſions. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, whether conſidered definitely or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, conteining both the decree and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not to be called meerely abſolute in reſpect of impulſive and finall cauſes, but is grounded partly in Gods will, partly in mans ſinne, a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition partly proved already, and theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low will confirme it the more. The 2. therefore is this. The impulſive cauſe why God did repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſome, and not all, according to both the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and affirmative act, was not the fore-ſeene ſinne of any, but the will of God: for firſt God did fore-ſee ſinne, not onely in ſome but in all. If therefore it had beene for ſinne, hee would have reprobated all as well as any one. Secondly, the potter makes not all to bee veſſels of diſhonour, becauſe he will. So God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18580:49"/>
               <p>Thirdly, why God did reprobate indefinitely ſome, definitely theſe by the negative act from grace, the cauſe was his meere will, why from glorie partly his good will, partly the ſinne of the wicked. For the firſt, ſee <hi>Eſau</hi> reprobated from grace, by no deſert, but of Gods meere will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. God cals to grace whom he will, gives the meanes of ſalvation, the Word and Sacraments, to whom he will, and calls not others becauſe hee will not. <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach in Bithynia, why? <hi>Becauſe the Spirit ſuffered them not, Acts</hi> 16.7. <hi>To you it is given, to others it is not given, to know the ſecrets of the Kingdome, Matth.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and revealed them to babes, becauſe it pleaſed thee, Matt.</hi> 11.25. The cauſe why hee reprobates indefinitely ſome, definitely theſe from glorie, is eſpecially the ſinne of the wicked, and I take it to bee ſound for this reaſon. God did eternally decree to reprobate men from glorie, for that for which hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reprobate them in time: but God reprobates from glorie, that is, debarres from it for ſinne and impietie: for, for this cauſe commeth the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. therefore for ſinne hee did decree not to give it. The cauſe of the affirmative act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to the puniſhment of induration, is Gods will, <hi>whom he will he hardeneth, Rom.</hi> 9.18. to the puniſhment of damnation, for ſinne; <hi>for the ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die, Ezech.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, why God did theſe more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, this man more than that, both by the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18580:49"/>and affirmative act, there is no cauſe in men, but onely the will and pleaſure of God, becauſe he would ſo. Why he freeth this man rather than that, let him that can, ſearch it out, ſo great is the depth of Gods judgements, but let him take heed of a downe-fall;<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>105.</hi> ad Sixtum.</note>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18580:50"/>conformitie to the image of the Sonne of God. So <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30.

                  </label> To ſtay the trembling and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts of many of Gods people in the day of temptation; for though they fall, yet ſhall they riſe againe; <hi>The moſt juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth againe, Prov.</hi> 24.16. The deareſt of Gods ſervants may ſinne, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and as <hi>David,</hi> and yet be pardoned and received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie againe. Yet obſerve a difference betweene to ſinne, and to make or commit a ſinne. They ſinne that deflect never ſo little from the ſtrictneſſe of the Law, whether it be of ignorance, infirmitie, or malice, they doe doe and commit ſinne, who ſinne purpoſely, although they have not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the worke. As Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Iudas,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was in his heart, <hi>what thou doeſt, doe quickly:</hi> So that to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, that hypocrites and unbeleevers may for a while bee counted amongſt the branches of Chriſts owne planting, though they be not ſuch.

In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.18, 19. they left the houſe of the Lord God of their fathers, and ſerved Idols in groves; yet God ſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to bring them againe to the Lord, but they would not heare. The Prophets are ſuch as <hi>Eliſha</hi> called <hi>Elias,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.12. <hi>My father, my father, the chariots of Iſrael, and the horſe-men of the ſame.</hi> Father, to ſignifie the love and good will of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to the people; and the chariots and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that is by a metaphor, the power and ſtrength of Iſrael, ſaith <hi>Iunius;</hi> the Prophets they are the Seers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. <hi>He is now called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that was in old time called a Seer;</hi> and if the Seers were once out of the way, into what error would not the blinde multitude ſuddenly fall; and the point will bee cleare, if wee conſider the Prophets dutie, which if undone, the people muſt needs fall. Firſt, he reproves them for ſin, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people for making the golden Calfe, and had there beene no Prophet to reprove, they would have gone on in their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.21. Secondly, to denounce judgement upon Idolaters, to keepe the people from that ſinne. So <hi>Elias,</hi> for idolatrie erected by <hi>Ahab,</hi> proclaimeth a famire and want of raine for three yeares and ſix moneths, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.1. Thirdly, they be meſſengers to acquaint the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the will of God, as <hi>Iethro</hi> wiſht <hi>Moſes</hi> in another caſe; <hi>Admoniſh them of the ordinances and lawes, and ſhew them the way wherein they muſt

Now if the Prophets be taken away which ſhould admoniſh, if the Prophets bee made away which muſt threaten ſinners, if there be no Prophets to lead them, or ſpeake to the people from God, how ſhould they chuſe but fall to everie ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? And therefore when wicked men would miſlead the people into a wrong path, they take a ready courſe to put out their eyes, and take away the Seers which are the Prophets.

               <p>And ſo I proceed to that which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ground of this preſervation, viz. <hi>the election of grace.</hi> S. <hi>Origen</hi> in his wandring ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,<note place="margin">Origen. in Rom. <hi>11.</hi>

               <p>Election is that part of Gods eternall predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Election de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> whereby hee decreed before all eternity, that they whom he loved in Chriſt, ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the adoption of ſonnes, iuſtified by faith, ſhould doe good workes, bee glorified, and made conformable to the image of his Son; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is begun when we are juſtified, increaſed daily by good workes; finiſhed in eternall glory: and all this that God may ſhew upon them the riches of his mercy, that it is of thoſe whom hee loved in Chriſt: it is manifeſt; for whatſoever good we have of God, it is by and through Chriſt. 2. That they ſhould be called. So the Apoſtle, hee hath choſen us to be adopted through Ieſus Chriſt unto himſelfe, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 1.5. 3. That they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18580:78"/>ſhould bee juſtified. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. whom hee called, them he juſtified. 4. To be glorified. Ibid. 5. That they may bee conformable to the image of his Sonne. See <hi>Paul,</hi> 8.29. Out of all theſe ariſe three concluſions. 1. God did elect and choſe becauſe hee looked mercifully vpon vs in Chriſt. 2. Whomſoever hee did choſe unto glory, he did predeſtinate to be holy.<note place="margin">Homines non producit Deus ad gloriam per ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera &amp; flagitiae.

If all depend on this, let us learne whether wee belong unto it or no, that we may know whether we ſhall ever bee glorified or no. There is no way to know it but by the fruits, as 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. The fruits are many, I will note for your comfort ſome. 1. good workes. 2. a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable care of the meanes of ſalvation. 3. The ſpirit of prayer. 4. Abalienation from the world. 5. Hungring and thirſting after righteouſnes. 6. Conflict betweene the fleſh &amp; ſpirit. 7. New obedience. 8. Love to Gods miniſters. 9. A long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the fulneſſe and complement of Chriſts comming as above: and ſo I come to the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cauſe of election, <hi>Grace.</hi> Amongſt men they are ſaid to have grace, <hi>Cui favet populus. Who have the good will and love of the people.</hi> And ſo with God, they are ſaid to have grace, who have found grace with God. But here is a manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: men favour none, but in whom they finde ſomething whereby they may bee allured to love them: but God loved not becauſe he ſaw vs to be lovely, for hee loved us firſt, and by loving us, gave us that which pleaſeth him. So that the name of grace in Scripture is uſed two wayes. 1. For the free love and favour of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee imbraceth the elect. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>We are predeſtinate to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> 2. Grace ſignifies the gifts freely beſtowed upon us by God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. The gifts, that is, the graces of God, <hi>are without repentance,</hi> as

                  </note> But the Papiſt by grace underſtands the gifts of grace conferred upon them that bee juſtified, as the infuſed habit of faith, good workes, &amp;c.

                  </note> But theſe bee the ſame; grace diſtinguiſht onely in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: for grace doth firſt cure the will, and ſo it is working. 2. It cauſed the will being cured to doe rightly, and ſo it is co-working. In the firſt, mans will concurs with grace paſſively and grace only workes; but in the other, when mans will is regenerate, it concurres both actively and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively; and ſo grace and mans will be co-operant. I will not trouble you with thoſe diſtinctions into prevenient and ſubſequent, which are but one, and by the ſame grace hee prevents us that wee may will, hee followes us by making us to doe, he prevents us by moving us to good workes, hee followes us by giving perſeverance: nor with that of grace into grace freely given, and making acceptable.

                  <hi>was nothing in man, but the free mercie of God;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Hee hath choſen us in him. Hee hath choſen us according to the good pleaſure of his will. Hee hath accepted us in his Beloved, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace, wee have the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes according to his rich grace.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace are yee ſaved, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Ob.</hi> Yea, but the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Yee are ſaved by grace through faith,</hi> therefore not onely grace but our owne faith is the cauſe of ſalvation. I anſwer: Faith is not here conſidered as any worke of ours, but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby we receive grace, and he muſt needs receive grace, who will be ſaved by grace, and how is grace received but by the hand of faith? therefore faith doth not properly juſtifie, and ſave a man either in whole or in part, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth righteouſneſſe and ſalvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid to juſtifie, becauſe it receiveth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and righteouſneſſe; and is the hand or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument receiving, but not deſerving grace and ſalvation. And when we ſay that faith doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, it is in reſpect of the object apprehended, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, who only effectually and properly doth juſtifie by his grace. So that this faith is ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18580:80"/>farre from being derogatorie from grace, that no man can have grace that hath not faith to receive it; and the Apoſtle joynes them fitly together, grace whereby wee are ſaved, and faith by which we apprehend it; that which ſaves effectually, and that which ſaves inſtrumentally, that is, grace and faith. As the Iſraelites ſtung by ſerpents, were healed by the brazen Serpent, ſo are wee by Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14, 15. But they did nothing but onely looke upon the brazen Serpent; ſo are we to doe nothing for our juſtification, but to fix the eye of faith upon Chriſt; whence wee ſee who muſt have the glorie for our ſalvation, namely God. 2. How vile and miſerable we were before grace, that there was nothing in us why God ſhould love us, or looke mercifully upon us, or purpoſe to ſave us.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed, there is yet one generall note to be collected hence. <hi>viz.</hi> That though the ſins of the Iewes deſerved a full rejection of them all, yet God did not conſider what they deſerved, but what might ſtand with his owne goodneſſe and mercie. So he did with rebellious <hi>Ephraim, I will not deſtroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man, Hoſ.</hi> 11.9. which is a wonderfull comfort to us poore ſinner; who many times deſerve to be caſt from Gods favour, to have the meanes of ſalvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied unto us, to bee caſt for ever from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; yet God will not doe it: for he conſiders what is ſit to be done in mercie, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres his judgement from us, and ſo I come to the concluſion of the application in the ſixth verſe.</p>

But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth mention election, he never makes mention of workes, unleſſe to exclude them, as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſpeakes, as here he doth; if of grace, then not of workes. Laſtly, if workes be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of election, then in neceſſitie they are of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alſo, for that rule in Logicke is conſtant; <hi>Whatſoever is the cauſe of the cauſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quicq. id eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſae cauſati.</note> 
                  <hi>is the cauſe of the thing cauſed.</hi> But good workes are not the cauſes of juſtification; for firſt, that which juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies is that which can anſwer the extremitie of Gods juſtice: But mans obedience cannot doe it, being onely a begun conformitie, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſpeakes.<note place="margin">Exam. Trident. Concil. Seſſ. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> To them that will doe good, evill is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Secondly, if juſtified by workes, then all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18580:82"/>boaſting is not excluded, but all boaſting is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>For wee are juſtified freely by grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus, Rom.</hi> 3.24. So that that which juſtifies a man, is the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and obedience, the juſtice of Chriſt our Mediator propoſed in the Word, apprehended by faith, and by God imputed to all that beleeve: So that we dare ſtand before God, if that Chriſt ſtand betweene God and our ſinnes; that is our buckler wherewith we are protected from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which we are emboldened to goe and appeare at the Tribunall of God, and are there pronounced juſt.

               </p>
               <p>For though it may ſeeme a charitable error in <hi>Origen,</hi> to thinke that all ſhall be ſaved at laſt, and the Patrons of univerſall grace build upon that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God will that all men ſhall bee ſaved:</hi> yet this muſt be meant either of the kindes of all, not of all of everie kinde, as <hi>Anſelmus.</hi> Some Iewes, ſome Gentiles; ſome noble, ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſome rich, ſome poore; ſome old, ſome young; ſome learned, ſome unlearned; or elſe of his outward will offering them the word, to leave them without excuſe, not of the will of his decree or good pleaſure. The Scripture is plaine, <hi>Many ſhall ſeeke to enter, and ſhall not be able, Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Many are called, but few choſen, Matth.</hi> 20.16. There be goats as well as ſheepe, chaffe as well as wheat, and bad fiſh that muſt bee throwen away: there be ſome to whom Chriſt will ſay, <hi>Depart from mee, Matth.</hi> 7.22. ſome to whom Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Goe you curſed into hell, prepared,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. there be many that ſhall be thruſt out of doores, when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall be received; there be many dogs, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.15. They have beene without God, and now they ſhall bee without glorie, and without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Vaine therefore is the preſumption of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prophane and wretched miſcreants, who will needs live, and die, and rot in ſinne, and yet thinke to be ſaved by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſay

               <p>Iſrael obtained not life, becauſe he ſought it in his owne righteouſneſſe. There ariſe two maine points: the one; <label type="milestone">

And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> praves that he may <hi>befound in Chriſt, not having on his righteouſneſſe, but the righteouſneſſe which is of God through faith, Phil.</hi> 3.9. For in this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, there is 1. Puritie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, to anſwer for our corrupt nature. 2.

               <p>The 2. point to bee noted is, that they are here called Iſrael, who in the end of the verſe are called <hi>the reſt,</hi> and here they that are ſaid not to have obtained, are in the end ſaid to bee hardeed: from whence the point is. <label type="milestone">

The manner, that we ſeeke in faith; for though he be never ſo farre gone, yet faith will fetch him: and in prayer; for if hee bee never ſo cloſely hid, yet prayer will finde him, as <hi>Gregory</hi> on the 6 peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Pſalme: and in humility; for if he be never ſo high, yet humility will reach him; this is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> 2.

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:18580:87"/>A point which I uſe to build upon theſe foure props againſt all the contrary windes of Popiſh oppoſition, as above; and ſo I come to the third clauſe in the propoſition: The reſt have beene hardned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the reſt have beene hardned:</hi> I meet with it againe in the next verſe, where I ſhall ſhew you in what ſence and how farre God is ſaid to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and to will ſinne, and yet be farre from being author of it. In the meane time, ſee the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, and one doctrine. In the greeke it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the vulgar and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tranſlate, they are blinded, of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to change into a ſtony hardneſſe, and amongſt Phyſicians is aſmuch as to harden with an overgrowne-thicke skin, as much as the brawne, or hardneſſe of a mans hands or feet by much labour. And in the Hebrew the word ſometimes ſignifies to harden that it cannot bee bent; and notes, 1. a naturall malice and hardneſſe, 2. a contracted hardnes, &amp; under this underſtand both that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes when of ſoft a thing is made hard, &amp; when of hard is made harder, as iron hard of it ſelfe, yet ſoftned with fire, and then put in cold water, is harder than before. Sometimes it ſignifies to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate, as if the heart were then hindred with ſome great weight, that it could not lift up it ſelfe to contemplate the workes of God, and embrace grace when it is offered. In <hi>Iſay</hi> 6.10. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the eares of men, when the hearing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie is hindred by the acceſſe of ſome vitious humour, either within or without it, that it can
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18580:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>either not at all, or hardly perceive any ſound; what kinde of hardneſſe this is, (<hi>viz.</hi> that it is not of the hands or fingers, but of the eyes, the eares, the heart) will appeare in the two next verſes, out of <hi>Iſay</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> So I come to Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Induration and hardneſſe of mans heart is a fearefull ſigne of reprobation; for whereas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation there bee two acts; 1. Affirmative. 2. Negative. The affirmative hath two degrees; the one a juſt induration. 2. An ordaining to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and where there is the one, it is to be feared the other will follow: and therefore you read not in Scripture that any people were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but ſurely deſtruction followed. In <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 11.20. when ſome of the Hivites that inhabited Gibeon made peace with Iſrael, it came of the Lord to harden the hearts of the reſt, to the intent that they might be deſtroyed, and have no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhewed to them: So it is ſaid of Sion King of Heſhbon, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.30. that when he would not let Iſrael paſſe by him, The Lord hardened his ſpirit, and made his heart obſtinate, becauſe hee would deliver him up to bee deſtroyed. So it is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Hee ſhall not hearken but his heart ſhall be hardened, that I may lay mine hand upon Aegypt.</hi> So that when God hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to proceed to judgement againſt wicked men, he lets them alone to worke ungodlineſſe, to live in diſobedience; to be hard-hearted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in ſinning; as in the ſonnes of <hi>Eli;</hi> they obeyed not the voice of their father, <hi>viz.</hi> God left them, and gave them not grace to hearken
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18580:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe he meant to ſlay them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. and all this is not meant of that hardneſſe, which is naturally even in the beſt; for God many times takes away that hardneſſe, and gives hearts of fleſh, that may bleed and weepe for ſinne, and turne to be ſaved, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your ſtony heart, and give you an heart of fleſh:</hi> but it is principally meant of a contracted kinde of hardneſſe, when men hearing the word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould bee conuerted, and judgements whereat the heart ſhould melt, as did the heart of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. yet notwithſtanding make their faces impudent, and their hearts hard, and reſolve to march on in their ſinfull wayes; this hardneſſe is the verie harbinger of death, and the fore-runner of everlaſting deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Which makes mine heart to tremble,<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and my bowels to yearne, and my ſoule to mourne in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for many of our people, whoſe hearts be like to anvils, the more they are beaten, the harder they grow; who have both ſeene and heard the judgements of God, and taſted the ſweet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, yet have neither beene affrighted from ſinne by judgement, nor allured to holineſſe by mercie; ſurely all the ſignes and ſymptomes of deſtruction are upon them: when man breakes the Sabbath, heares the promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.5. and caſts it behinde his backe, the threats and puniſhments, as the man ſtoned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. that he will kindle a fire in their gates that ſhall never be quenched, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.27. and makes his face hard againſt them, and goes on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18580:88"/>ſtill in his wickedneſſe, muſt needs be in the ſtate of reprobation, and hath all the marks and tokens of a caſtaway upon him.

               <p>In the firſt proofe I note: 1. The judgement. 2. The Author. 3. The continuance. The judge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, <hi>the ſpirit of ſlumber:</hi> 1. Generall. 2.

And 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The Lord bade them turne from their evill wayes, but they would not obey, but hardened their hearts and necks, like to the necks of their fathers, that did not beleeve in the Lord their God.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18580:90"/>haſt ſtricken them, but they have not ſorrowed; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and have made their faces harder than a ſtone;</hi> which phraſe is frequent in the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> as in <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.26. <hi>They hardened their necks, and did worſe than their fathers.</hi> And <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.23. <hi>They made their necks ſtiffe and would not heare:</hi> by which it appeares, that ungodly and wicked men are a cauſe of their owne hardening, when they either oppoſe the truth acknowledged, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in ſinne againſt their conſcience, as may bee ſeene in <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Iudas,</hi> and the Iewes.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe is the Devill,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart.</note> helping forward the wicked and ſinfull purpoſes of man, plunging him everie day further than other into finne, and eaſting thicke and foggie miſts over his eyes, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that periſh, in whom the God of this world hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the mindes, that the light of the Goſpell might not ſhine unto them:</hi> which God of this world is not the true &amp; everliving God, as <hi>Chryſoſtome, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounded it, when they dealt with the Manichees and Arrians; but the ſame which is called, the Prince that ruleth in the aire, the Prince of darkneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Devill, and theſe two efficients of induration doe both ſinne moſt grievouſly, man by his owne will, Satan by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; mans corruption is as the coale that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth ſparkes, the Devill blowes the coales and kindles the fire.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe is God: for firſt,<note place="margin">The third cauſe of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe of heart.</note> mans heart ſends forth fire, Satan blowes it, and then God
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18580:91"/>ſtrikes on the anvill, and frames and diſpoſeth everie thing to his owne will. The firſt and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt cauſe is mans corruption, the Inſtigator and Tempter Satan, and God as a juſt Iudge. <hi>I will harden Pharaohs heart, ſaith God, Exod.</hi> 4.21. <hi>The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.12. And the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 63.17. queſtions thus with God, <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our hearts from thy feare:</hi> So God is ſaid to <hi>give men over to a reprobate ſenſe and reprobate minde, Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>To blinde, Iſay</hi> 6.10. <hi>To deceive, Ezek.</hi> 14.9. <hi>If that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet be deceived, then I the Lord have deceived him; to put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of his Prophet,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Behold the Lord hath put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all theſe Prophets.</hi> Now how God doth harden and blinde is not agreed. Some ſay, that all thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Hee hardened Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs heart, and hee gave them over to a reprobate minde,</hi> &amp;c. are to be expounded, by the word of permitting, that God did ſuffer them to be done, and not without ſhew of Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>They would not hearken; therefore I gave them up to the hardneſſe of their heart, and let them walke in their owne counſells.</hi> And alſo from the ſpeech of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 14.15, 16. when the people of Lyſtra would have ſacrificed unto them, <hi>Why doe you theſe things? we be men as you are, who preach unto you the living God, who made all things, and in times paſt ſuffered the Gentiles to walke in their owne luſts;</hi> and when it is ſaid, that <hi>God gave them over to doe ſuch things as are not

That God is no otherwiſe ſaid to harden, or blinde, but by with-drawing his grace, which they that are blinded and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened are unworthy of: As the ſhip-man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his helpe, lets the ſhip be drowned, or a man that takes away the pillar that ſuſtained the houſe, then the houſe fals of it ſelfe; and there bee two cauſes why God uſeth to withdraw his grace and ſpirit: ſometimes to puniſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull that abuſe his grace, ſometimes that they might better acknowledge the neceſſitie of grace; that without it wee can doe nothing that is good, that wee may bee more enflamed with a deſire of it, and embrace it joyfully when wee feele it; and for theſe cauſes God ſometimes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18580:92"/>denies his ſervants the powerfull working of his Spirit, and ſuffers them to fall into foule ſins, and that not onely in juſtice to puniſh former ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but alſo in mercie and for their good; both in the ſight of our owne weakneſſe, and in ſeeing the neceſſitie of Gods grace, and in making us more carefull not to abuſe grace when we have it; So that God doth blinde when he takes away his light; for take away light, darkneſſe followes; take away grace, hardneſſe followes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſayes; That God is ſuch a cauſe of ſinne, as is called in Philoſophie, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving prohibiting cauſe, that takes away the helpe by which they ſhould bee kept from indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and though this bee ſomewhat, yet it is not all: for ſurely theſe ſayings, <hi>God did harden, give over to a reprobate minde, lead into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and encline the hearts of men,</hi> doe ſignifie ſome action of God in man.</p>
               <p>Some come a little neerer and ſay, that God doth blinde and harden not by his owne, but by an outward act indirectly, that is, by propoſing to the eyes and eares ſuch objects whereby they ſhould be ſoftned, and enlightned, and reclaimed from ſinne; but yet it comes to paſſe by their owne faults, that they are thereby blinded, and hardened, and plunged further into ſinne: Theſe objects are, the preaching of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, miracles, mercies, judgements. Theſe God giveth to man for his good, and man turnes them to his owne deſtruction. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, God propoſed the Word to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18580:92"/>

The hid action of God in the heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> And theſe three God did thus order; that <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould ſpeake the word, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould doe miracles, but hee would reſerve to himſelfe the action of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; <hi>I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 4.21. as if he ſhould ſay, I will reſerve that to my ſelfe: So that beſides the outward objects of the Word, and miracles propoſed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> there was an internall action of hardening wrought by God; not to goe ſtill about the point, the concluſion is. God doth blinde, harden, and give over to a reprobate minde, not onely by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it, not onely by withdrawing his grace and helping hand, nor onely by propoſing of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward objects, againſt which the wicked may ſtumble; but alſo by an inward and ſtrange wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the heart of man, and all theſe be acts of Gods juſt judgement, whereby hee puniſheth mans ſinne. So that hardneſſe and excaecation in reſpect of it ſelfe is ſinne, In reſpect of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, the cauſe of ſinne, and it is in reſpect of

                  </gap>God workes, is difficult; from the blame God is free, from the guilt he is alſo free: let man looke to both theſe. But the puniſhment of ſinne being an act of his juſtice, hee acknowledgeth; and in the puniſhment note three things. 1. The matter wherewith a man is puniſhed. 2. The contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betweene the partie and the puniſhment. 3. The order of conſequence; that where ſuch an offence went before, ſuch an evill ſhall follow, to make the offender feele the ſmart of it: In thoſe puniſhments which be puniſhments onely and not ſinnes, God is the Author of all things implyed. In thoſe which be ſinnes as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, God is onely the Author of the order of conſequence, and of the contrarietie betweene the puniſhments and the parties puniſhed; as for example: Pride is puniſht by envie; now envie is not of God. But there is a contrarietie betweene the ſoule of a proud man and it; which makes it bitter and afflictive, and there is an order of conſequence, that where ſuch a ſinne went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there ſuch a puniſhment ſhould follow; This is of God: So that God workes in ſinne. 1. Poſitively, as it is a phyſicall act. 2. Morally, as it is a juſt puniſhment of ſin. 3. Permiſſively, as it is a ſin, not by giving conſent to the doing of it, but in not hindring it.</p>

                  </note> But wee ſay that induration and excaecation bee juſt judgements of God. <hi>He hardens none but deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> and in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement there bee theſe parts to bee conſidered. Firſt, the withdrawing of his divine helpe; <hi>Not by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing malice, but by withdrawing grace.</hi> The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of precedent ſinne, when God takes away thoſe helps of grace which formerly they had, and when man wants this help, of his owne accord hee ruſheth into ſinne. Hence <hi>Pharaos</hi> heart grew hard, becauſe God would not give him grace to hearken to his miniſters <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron: And the Gentiles having their cogitations darkened;</hi> that is, God not enlightening them with his grace, <hi>they gave themſelves over unto wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and to worke all iniquity with greedineſſe: Eph.</hi> 4.18.19. and this denying of grace is no ſinne, becauſe it doth not conferre grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the delivering of man into the power of Satan, which is Gods juſt judgement upon man for ſinne: as 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.22. when hee bade Satan deceive the falſe Prophets. <hi>Thou ſhalt intice him, and prevaile, goe forth and doe ſo;</hi> and in this no ſin; for Satan being the executioner of Gods anger and judgements, doth ſo plunge thoſe that are turned over to him into eternall deſtruction, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18580:94"/>he puniſheth their former ſinnes by making them commit greater than they did before: thus did God with the wicked people. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they regarded not to know God; therefore God gave them over,</hi> that Sathan might puniſh them by driving them into greater ſinnes than ever they had committed before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, divine permiſſion, when God ſuffers Sathan and wicked men to runne into ſinne, but without his furtherance, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>My people would not hearken, Iſrael would not obey; therefore I gave them over to the hardneſſe of their heart, &amp; let them follow their owne imaginations:</hi> &amp; as he did here with the Iewes, ſo did he with the Gentiles. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. <hi>The God that made heaven &amp; earth in time paſt ſuffered all the Gentiles to walke in their owne waies:</hi> and in <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.16. <hi>I ſet all men every one againſt his brother;</hi> and yet in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion God is neither altogether unwilling that it ſhould bee done; for it were impoſſible to bee done, if God were wholly againſt it; neither is he ſimply willing, becauſe hee doth both hate ſinne and puniſh it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. So that if permiſſion be referred to the act of ſinne, God hates it, wills it not, but unwilling permits it, but if referred to the end (not which the agent doth intend, but which the divine wiſdome deduceth from thence) then he permits it willingly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the determination of ſinne, when God will not ſuffer the wicked to goe on in ſinne ſo farre as they deſire, but ſets them bounds that they cannot goe beyond; and as hee did with the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18580:94"/>ſeas, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.11. <hi>Hither ſhalt thou goe,</hi> as hee did with Sathan in the tempting of <hi>Iob, All that hee hath is in thy power, but upon himſelfe put not forth thy hand, Iob</hi> 1.12. as hee did with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he ſuffered him to vex and perſecute Iſraell: but when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have maliciouſly brought them backe againe, and intended more exquiſite cruelty for them, then the Lord ſtayed him and ſtopt his paſſage, by bringing in the ſea to drowne him and his hoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. as hee did with <hi>Saul</hi> when he would have taken away <hi>Davids</hi> life, the Lord ſet downe how farre hee ſhould proceed, to chaſe him from place to place, but not to death: By all which it appeares, that wee make not God to bee an idle looker on, which ſuffers every creature to doe what they will: But when God gives men over to bee blinded and hardned by Sathan, and ſuffers wicked men for a time to worke miſchiefe, yet ſets bounds and limitts to their rage and fury, and in the end wonderfully reſcues his ſervants from trouble: This ſurely is not to doe nothing.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a reducing of the ends to the rule of juſtice.

So in the death of Chriſt, Sathan and the Iewes intended onely his death; but God turned it to the ſalvation of all that beleeve.

That God doth not onely permit the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to doe evill, nor onely forſake the godly, that the wicked may doe what they will againſt them: But he overſees their wills, he rules their wills, he governs their wills, nay he bowes and bends them by working inviſibly in them, and not only inclines the will to one evill rather than to another, by permitting them to bee carried into one ſinne and not into another, but alſo poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee bends them by inclining them to one evill and turning them from another, occaſionally and morally as hee ſpeakes out of <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> Let them looke well into theſe ſpeeches and they ſhall finde that wee ſay no more than they; and if they would expound ours as candidly as

               <p>Briefly then we ſay firſt in generall, That God is not the author of ſinne, but the devill and mans corrupt will, and the contrary we defie as blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Secondly in particular, wee beleeve, that God wills nothing which is formerly ſinne (but hee fulfills his good wills by our evill wills, as <hi>P. Lombard</hi>) as hee wills that which is good,<note place="margin">Lib <hi>1.</hi> Diſtinct. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> but hates it rather; whence it followes, that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires it into no man, nor creates any corruption in our wills which was not there before, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it abſolutely, within us by the light of his ſpirit, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. without, by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt heare a word behinde thee ſaying, this is the way turne not out of it. Iſay.</hi> 39.21. &amp;c. The firſt entrance of ſinne into the world, and the continuance of it in the world, was the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary action of mans will, God infuſing no evill into him; for God is not the cauſe why man is worſe: but that which God doth about and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſinne is contained in three actions. Firſt, as the univerſall cauſe of all things hee ſuſtaines mankinde, and upholds his being, yea the being &amp; motion of all his actions good and bad: So that no man could either move to any action, or have being himſelfe, if God ſuſtained him not, as <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. whence it followes, that the very poſitive act, which the ſchoolemen call the ſubject of ſinne, and the materiall part of ſin whereto ſinne cleaveth, is of God in the ſame ſort that all other actions of the creature are; &amp; this propoſition doth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18580:96"/>
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> well illuſtrate: A man rides upon a lame horſe: in this action are two things, Motion and Halting; the motion is of man, man makes him move, but his halting is of himſelfe: ſo in ſinne, the action or motion is of God, but the deformity, of man himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he withholds his grace, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.39. <hi>Therefore they could not beleeve, becauſe Iſay ſaith, he hath blinded, &amp;c.</hi> as being bound to no man, but leaves the wicked to themſelves, whereupon it followes that their hearts grow hard, and they cannot choſe but ſinne. The manner how hee hardneth, is not by creating the ſinne, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> Not by infuſing malice, but by withdrawing grace, as hee doth grace in the elect; but by denying them the power of his grace, which ſhould mollifie them, and by offering them ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry objects as the Word and Goſpell, which they convert into occaſions of ſinne and ruine, and whereby they ſtand expoſed to Sathans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and have neither power, nor will to ſtay themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee ordinates the ſinne, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the directing of it in ſuch manner as hee pleaſeth, that it proceed no further, nor otherwiſe than his good pleaſure willeth; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee reſtraines it, that it ſhall reach no farther than hee willeth; ſometimes he turnes it to another end than the perſon doing it thought of, he would Chriſt ſhould ſuffer by the Iewes, he would not that the Iewes ſhould ſlay him, as <hi>Lombard:</hi>

For like the blinde man, hee that wanteth the light and ſight of the minde cannot guide himſelfe in his wayes, but is ready everie ſtep to erre and goe aſtray into the by-wayes of error and ſinne; he is apt to ſtumble at everie ſtone of offence that lieth in his way, and ſo to fall into ruine and perdition; he is in danger to ſlip into everie hole, and to fall into everie pit which the enemies of his ſalvation doe dig for him, to be catched in everie trap and ſnare of tentation that is laid in his way; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne betweene the faire and ſure path of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and the foule ſloughes and deepe ditches of ſinfull corruptions

For what can they doe otherwiſe, ſo long as they are under this heavie judgement of ſpirituall blindneſſe? What can be expected of mad men, but the fruits and effects of folly and phrenſie?

                  <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> In which conſider, 1. The judgement it ſelfe: 2. The continuance of it. The judgement is expreſſed like the former, in a metaphoricall ſpeech taken from the body; where conſider, 1. the matter, and 2. the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of it. The matter is their utter weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and diſabling to all good actions ſpirituall, civill, and corporall, inward, and outward. For the Hebrewes ſeat the chiefe ſtrength of man in his back and loynes, which being broken, bowed, and buckled together, he is thereby made utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any actions and employment. So that the meaning is as if hee had ſaid; Diſable them wholly unto all holy and Chriſtian duties, ſo as they may have neither power not will to performe any holy ſervice unto God, to receive Chriſt as their Lord, or to yeeld unto him obedience as to their Sovereigne; let them bow downe under the intolerable burthen of their ſinnes (eſpecially that of crucifying their Saviour) without eaſe or comfort. Deprive their ſtate of all ſtrength, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18580:115"/>pull out of their hands all civill government, which they have abuſed to Gods diſhonour, to the oppoſing of Chriſt in his Kingdome, and to the dammage and hurt of all his ſubjects and members: overthrow their whole policie and Common-wealth, ſubdue them as vaſſals and ſlaves to all their enemies, and make them wholly deſolate. The which heavie judgements we ſee accordingly inflicted upon that Nation. For their Kingdome was quite overthrowen by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> their politicke Lawes and government taken away, their cities and townes ſacked and fired, their people for the moſt part ſlaughtered, and the remainder ſold for ſlaves, and ſcattered among all Nations, under whoſe ſervitude they remaine in great ſcorne and reproach even unto this day. And thus alſo we ſee their backes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in reſpect of ſpirituall ſtrength. For no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Heaven is more deſperately wicked, and averſe to all goodneſſe; none ſo maliciouſly oppoſite to Chriſt and his kingdome, whom they delight to diſgrace with reproaches and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; none more given up to a reprobate minde, to couetouſneſſe, ſordide baſeneſſe, injuſtice, and all manner of deceit. A people ſeparated from all nations, that they may bee the ſcorne of of all. And this is the matter of the judgement. The manner or qualitie of it is implyed by that phraſe of <hi>bowing, or making crooked.</hi> For as thoſe whoſe backes are broken and bowed, doe bend their faces downeward towards the earth, and are not able without great difficultie to lift them up
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18580:115"/>towards heaven: So this nation being broken with Gods heavie judgements, &amp; weakened in all their ſtrength, ſpirituall and civill, had this heavie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment added to all the reſt, that hereby like bruit beaſts their faces were bowed towards the earth, aſcribing all their calamities to worldly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and inferiour cauſes, and never looking up unto God as the chiefe Author of them, that they might humble themſelves under his mighty ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſee &amp; acknowledge their ſins, which were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe heavie judgements, and turning unto God by unfained repentance, might obtaine the pardon of them, reconciliation with God through Chriſt, and freedome from their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And this is the judgement denounced againſt the unbeleeving Iewes. The time of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it is expreſſed in this word <hi>alway:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified the durableneſſe of theſe heavy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which were to continue ſo long, as though they ſhould never have end. The which wee ſee verified in the event, ſeeing ſince their deſtruction and deſolation, almoſt 1600. yeares are paſſed, and yet in outward appearance they are as farre from deliverance out of their great calamitles, as they were the firſt day.</p>
               <p>The points to bee obſerved from hence are theſe: <label type="milestone">

                  </label> 1. <hi>How much God hateth, and how ſeverely he puniſheth the ſinne of infidelitie, whereby Christ the Saviour of the world is rejected;</hi> Seeing for this ſinne principally the nation of the Iewes, who were ſo highly in Gods favour, and partakers of all the prerogatives of his Church and people,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18580:116"/>have beene rejected and fearefully puniſhed, and that for the ſpace of ſo many hundred yeares. Neither indeed can it be otherwiſe; for how can his ſores but feſter, that refuſeth to apply that only plaſter, whereby they may be cured? How can they but continue loſt, and in the ſtate of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who reject their only Saviour? How can they be reconciled unto God, that refuſe to have any part in him in whom alone hee is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Finally, how ſhould they but remaine under the guilt and condemnation of all their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that having ſlaine the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſins of the world, doe not repent of this their horrible impietie.</p>

               <p>In the firſt part of this Chapter, from the firſt to the end of the tenth verſe, the Apoſtle hath ſhewed and proved, that the fall of the Iewes

Vnto which hee maketh way by a Prolepſis or preoccupation, anſwering an objection which might be made by the Iewes againſt his former Doctrine to this purpoſe; If it be ſo as you ſay <hi>Paul,</hi> that God hath expoſed the Iewes to thoſe judgements foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that is, brought them into ſuch ſnares, laid ſtumbling blockes before them, blinded their eyes, and bowed and broken their backs, whereby they are utterly diſabled to all good actions, civill, morall, and ſpirituall; then belike you conclude that their caſe is deſperate, as being caſt off by God without hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Vnto which the Apoſtle replyeth, that though this were the ſtate of the Iewes for a time, yet it ſhould not be ſo for ever, but there ſhould be a time (namely, when the <hi>fulneſſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles was come in,</hi>) that they alſo ſhould be called and added to the Church, that ſo both Iewes and Gentiles might make but one flocke, in one ſheepfold, and under one Shepherd.

Which were not that they ſhould periſh and be damned, but that way hereby might be made for the calling of the Gentiles, and thereby alſo the Iewes might at laſt be ſtirred up to jealouſie and emulation, and ſo alſo provoked to come in by following their example. For ſeeing the Iewes would not receive Chriſt themſelves, nor (as much as in them lay) ſuffer the Gentiles to receive him as their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, therefore it was juſt with God, that by their rejection way might bee made for the bringing in of the Gentiles into the Church, that receiving and embracing Chriſt by faith, all of them which belonged to Gods election might be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Whereby he acquitteth God from being ſuch an one as delighted in the deſtruction of his owne people, and ſheweth that the maine end at which hee aimed in their rejection, was not that they might bee deſtroyed and condemned; but partly to glorifie his juſtice, in puniſhing them juſtly for their infidelitie; and partly and chiefly to magnifie his mercie, in the effectuall calling
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18580:118"/>and ſalvation of the elect Gentiles, and at laſt that he might alſo extend it more fully and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to his ancient people in their converſion to the faith of Chriſt, that they alſo by him might be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The prolepſis is propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by way of interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the greater emphaſis: <hi>I ſay then; have they ſtumbled, that they ſhould fall?</hi> that is, have they ſo ſtumbled, according to the prediction of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as that they ſhall fall finally, &amp; never recover and riſe againe. In which the Apoſtles meaning is not, as though hee would demand whether it was the intention of the Iewes to ſtumble that they might fall, or fall finally, that way hereby might bee made for the calling of the Gentiles; (for none are ſo fooliſh as purpoſely to ſtumble that they may fall, or to fall finally that others may riſe) But his queſtion is concerning Gods intention, whether it were his purpoſe and end that they ſhould bee blinded and ſo ſtumble that they might fall finally into everlaſting deſtruction: and this hee denieth as being a thing contrary to Gods nature, ſeeing hee delighteth not in the death and deſtruction of his creatures, but rather in exerciſing his mercy and goodneſſe in their converſion and ſalvation, neither will hee who in his Law forbiddeth us to put a ſtumbling blocke before the blinde to cauſe them to fall,<note place="margin">Levit. 19.14.</note> himſelfe put ſuch a ſtumbling blocke before thoſe that he hath firſt ſpiritually blinded, that thereby he may cauſe them to fall into the pit of everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But he aimeth at farre other ends, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18580:118"/>is, the calling of the Gentiles, and the recalling of the Iewes: yea, but will God doe evill that good may come of it? I anſwer, no. But there is no action in it ſelfe abſolutely evill, which hath not ſome reſpect and relation of good in it. And ſo this, for howſoever this rejection was evill to them, yet not ſimply and abſolutely evill in it ſelfe, ſeeing as it came from God, it was an act of his juſtice, whereby hee puniſhed the Iewes for their infidelity and rebellion againſt Chriſt, whom by wicked hands they had crucified. Now as he juſtly puniſhed the Iewes by blinding, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and rejecting them who had ſtumbled at Chriſt the corner ſtone, and ſo fallen into that fearefull ſinne of <hi>crucifying with wicked hands the Lord of life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 2.23.</note> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh; ſo the Apoſtle here comforteth them by ſhewing that this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not for over extend to all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity and to the whole nation, but that there would come a time when as they ſhould be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed into Chriſt the true vine and olive tree, as well as the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>And this he doth firſt negatively, according to his cuſtome and phraſe, when as a thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded which he abominateth and abhorreth as monſtrous and blaſphemous, <hi>God forbid;</hi> and then affirmatively, where hee ſetteth downe that God had farre other ends of their rejection, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene ſhewed.

It is true, and wee muſt not denie it, that God by his long-ſuffering <hi>fitteth the veſſels of wrath to deſtruction, Rom</hi> 9.22. that <hi>theſe like naturall bruit beaſts are made to be taken and deſtroyed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. yea that <hi>theſe men of old were ordained to this condemnation,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.

Neither doth he abſolutely ordaine men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, without any other thing comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his decree and their condemnation; but only he decreeth to paſſe by them, to with-hold his grace which he is not bound to give, and to leave them to their owne ſinfull corruptions; and ſo being left to themſelves, and falling into all ſin and wickedneſſe, they are juſtly by God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſinnes in a ſecond place ordained to condemnation, as <hi>Iude</hi> affirmeth.

                  <hi>through the carnall corruption of their ſinfull nature, are apt to ſtumble at thoſe things which in their owne nature ſhould ſtay and ſupport them, as namely Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his Goſpell and holy ordinances.</hi> For the Iewes here ſtumble at Chriſt, who was purpoſely ſent to uphold and keepe them from falling. He was in himſelfe the <hi>chiefe Corner-ſtone</hi> to ſupport the whole building of his holy Temple and Church:<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.16.</note> And they, through their infidelitie, make him to become unto them a ſtone of offence, at which many of them ſtumbled, and fell into the pit of perdition. According to <hi>Simeons</hi> prophecie, that he <hi>ſhould bee ſet for the fall and riſing of many in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Luk.</hi> 2.34. Agreeable to that which <hi>Iſay</hi> foretold of him long before; namely, that hee who was unto his Saints <hi>a Sanctuarie of ſafetie, ſhould be for a ſtone and ſtumbling blocke, and for a rocke of offences to both the houſes of Iſrael, for a gin and a ſnare to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem.</hi> At which, <hi>Many among them ſhall ſtumble and fall,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18580:121"/>and be broken, and be ſnared, and be taken, Iſa.</hi> 8.14, 15. The which prophecie the Apoſtle fitteth to the Iewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. And as many ſtumble at this Corner ſtone, ſo alſo at his Word and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. The which as it is to the <hi>Iewes a ſtumbling blocke, ſo unto the Greekes fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 23. Yea, not onely ſtrangers and enemies, but even many that follow Chriſt in an outward profeſſion, and boaſt themſelves to bee his Diſciples, yet when hee preacheth high and holy myſteries of his ſpirituall union with his Church, doe ſtumble and fall at this ſtone of offence, and take occaſion thereby to leave and forſake him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.60, 66. Yea, even his holy Apoſtles, through naturall blindneſſe, did ſtumble at his heavenly doctrine; as <hi>Peter,</hi> when our Saviour foretold his paſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. And all the reſt, when he taught them the unlawfulnes of being divorced, unleſſe in the caſe of adulterie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.10. So when he taught with what difficultie rich men ſhould bee ſaved, they ſo ſtumbled thereat, that they were aſtoniſhed out of meaſure, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.26. And thus when the Miniſters of the word croſſe mens corrupt humours, and convince them of their ſinnes, they ſtumble at it, and will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them and their Miniſterie. <hi>Moſes</hi> is caſt out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> preſence, when hee delivereth Gods meſſage faithfully. <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Michaiah</hi> are counted <hi>Ahabs</hi> enemies, when they deale plainly with him, and tell him of his ſinnes. The Iewes will not endure <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 44.</note> when hee croſſeth their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18580:121"/>humour, and challenge him to be a falſe Prophet, who ſpake his owne word to them, and not the word of the Lord. <hi>Herod</hi> goeth on ſmoothly a good while, but when the Baptiſt reproved him for taking his brothers wife, he ſtumbleth at this ſtone, and is ſo incenſed againſt him, that hee muſt loſe his head for it. Thus alſo men make the word a ſtumbling blocke, when they make it a Sanctuarie to ſecure them in their ſinnes, and countenance themſelves in their wicked courſes, by wreſting and miſ-applying of the Scriptures. So reprove ſome men for the abuſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſhew them how God will bleſſe them that keepe it, out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. they quickly finde a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to make them ſinne, <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi> Tell wicked and voluptuous men, who ſpend their whole life in ſinfull delights; that it will not hold out before God, nor ſtand in judgement: They reply; What, will you allow a Gentleman no recreation? muſt man live without all delight? The Scripture affords recreation; then everie place of Scripture that allowes any recreation, muſt be an Advocate to plead in defence of their voluptuous and wicked lives; and all this toſſing and canvaſſing of Scripture is not a note of more wit, but of more wickedneſſe, and neere acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Devill. Such mens tongues are ſet on fire of Hell, and blowen by Satans ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king breath; and when they have ſaid what they are able, they doe but make their ſin more grievous, their heart more hard, God more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18580:122"/>themſelves more juſtly and more deeply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed than before.</p>
               <p>The third ſort that make the word a ſtumbling blocke, are they that refuſe to heare it, becauſe it makes againſt their ſinnes, wherewith they are in love, and diſcovers thoſe ſinkes of ſin in their hearts, which they cannot endure to be detected and laid open:<note place="margin">Amont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <hi>To provoke them to follow them.]</hi> There is (ſaith <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi>) a double emulation; Firſt, of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when one doth imitate another, and then the ſenſe is, that the Iewes ſhould imitate the ſaith and converſion of the Gentiles, and ſtrive to come into favour with God, as the Gentiles were. Secondly, of indignation, and then the meaning is, that the Iewes might emulate, that is, ſhould be moved with anger and indignation againſt them, according to that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.21. <hi>They have provoked mee to anger with that which is not God, and I will move them to iealouſie with thoſe which are no people,</hi> meaning the Gentiles. The true and proper ſenſe I take to be this: The Iewes manifeſtly ſaw, that the ſpirit, and grace, and knowledge of the Scriptures, and almoſt all ſpirituall bleſſings were tranſlated from them to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18580:129"/>the Gentiles; and therefore could not chuſe but grievouſly complaine, that they who were ſons, who were the proper and peculiar inheritance of God, who were <hi>the Lords portion and lot of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, Deut.</hi> 32.9. ſhould now be caſt off, and the Gentiles who were Heathens, Idolaters, ignorant of heaven and heavenly things, defiled with all kinde of pollution, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſhould come in their ſtead, poſſeſſe their roomes, be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with privileges, and that not by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man which might be erroneous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, but by the judgement of the immortall God who erreth not, who eſtabliſheth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; ſo that God would have the Iewes to take heavily the admiſſion of the Gentiles, and our ſalvation ſharply to bite them; that ſeeing what privileges they have loſt, and wee enjoy, they might imitate us, and come unto Chriſt from whom they have fallen.</p>
               <p>But who is it that doth <hi>provoke them?</hi> The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine and <hi>Origen</hi> underſtand it of the faith of the Gentiles, which ſhould provoke the Iewes to emulation. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> underſtand it of the Gentiles, that they ſhould provoke the Iewes (by their example) to beleeve. <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> quite contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles purpoſe, underſtands that the Gentiles ſhould imitate the Iewes. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith, that all this is referred to God; it is meant that God would provoke the Iewes,<note place="margin">Annotat <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> contrary to <hi>Tolet;</hi> and his judgement I rather embrace, becauſe of that ſaying, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.21. <hi>I will provoke them to iealouſie.</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:18580:129"/>But it will bee objected, that this is no commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable thing, by envy or by emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be brought to beleeve; whereto I anſwere, That God ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth not approve ſuch emulation, or envie: but as hee can uſe evill to good purpoſes, ſo by this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation it pleaſeth him to incite and ſtir up the Iewes to turne unto him, like as the husband puts away the adulterous wife, that ſhee thereby may bee provoked by a kinde of emulation to ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, leſt another ſhould come in her roome. Beſide this you muſt conceive this of the better ſort of the Iewes, they ſhall bee provoked, but not all; for the obſtinate ſhall be made worſe: laſtly, conceive it not of the Iewes in particular; for they which ſtumbled and fell away, were not reſtored: but of them in generall, that though ſome were beleevers, yet the whole nation was not caſt off. Thus much for the ſenſe: for the reading there is no great queſtion, onely mee thinkes that the vulgar doth ill tranſlate it, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>WHerein there is firſt an anſwer to an objection, for it may ſeeme that the one end doth quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18580:135"/>the other: for if the Iewes fel that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles might have place, and the Iewes bee to bee converted againe, then it ſeemes that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles muſt be caſt off againe, and ſo the converſion of the Iewes ſhall rather hinder the ſalvation of the Gentiles, which is contarie to the firſt part of the affirmative anſwer. This inference the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle denies, and inferres the quite contrarie, by an argument taken from the leſſe after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If the fall of the Iewes bee the riches of the world, then much more ſhall their abundance be the riches of the world: if their povertie were the riches of the world, how much more ſhall their plentifull calling be? If God turne that which is evill to the good of the Gentiles, how much more will he turne that which is good to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Gentiles? Before I come to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, ſee the expoſition of ſome hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult tearmes. 1. What is meant by riches of the world. Both the multitude of the Gentiles called to the knowledge of Chriſt, as <hi>Paraeus,</hi> and alſo that wherewith they were enlightned; namely, the ſaving knowledge of the Goſpell, the grace of Gods ſpirit, remiſſion of ſinnes, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red promiſe and expectation of eternall liſe. 2. What is meant by diminiſhing. Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Apoſtles, which were but few, and abjects of the people, yet they enriched the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by their preaching, and make the ſenſe thus: That if the converſion of ſo few (as the Apoſtles were) did ſo much good to the world; how much more the converſion of the whole Nation at the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18580:135"/>end of the world: So <hi>Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Gorrhan.</hi> But I thinke, that by diminution, is not meant the converſion of a few; but their falling away to a few. And that the Apoſtle uſeth theſe three words, as equipollent and of one ſenſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their fall; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their diminiſhing; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their caſting off. And in that hee ſaith they are diminiſhed, hee ſheweth that they are not quite periſht; for diminution is not <hi>Rei exciſio, ſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſio; Not the waſting or deſtruction of a thing, but a paring off,</hi> as <hi>Paraeus.</hi> 3. What is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their fulneſſe, or abundance, not onely <gap reason="foreign">

By fulneſſe wee muſt not underſtand, that everie particular Iew ſhall bee called at the end of the world; but of the moſt of them: and this fulneſſe is not to be underſtood with relation to the Gentiles, as though their number ſhould be more; for their fulneſſe muſt firſt be come in, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>Obſtinacie is come to Iſrael untill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in;</hi> but with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the whole number of Chriſts Church; that although there be a fulneſſe of the Gentiles without them, yet as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Plenitudo portio nis Dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The fulneſſe of the Lords portion is not complete without the Iewes.</hi> But how can this fulneſſe of the Iewes doe the Gentiles good? It ſhall doe them good; 1. By confirming the faith of the Gentiles; ſo <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi> 2. It ſhall enrich the Gentiles with doctrine
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18580:136"/>and example; ſo the Ordinarie Gloſſe. 3. The Church ſhall be encreaſed by the glorious acceſſe of a people; ſo <hi>Oſiander:</hi> So theſe benefits ſhall accrue to the Gentiles by the converſion of the Iewes. 1. The conſociation and joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of Iewes and Gentiles, the partition wall being broken downe againe. 2. The Church ſhall be increaſed; for then the children of Iſrael and of Iudah ſhall bee gathered together, &amp;c. as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.11. 3. The faith of the Gentiles ſhall bee confirmed, by ſeeing the zeale of the Iewes after their converſion. 4. God ſhall receive grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glorie, when his goodneſſe and the truth of his promiſes ſhall be made manifeſt, both in Iewes and Gentiles. But here is yet another doubt to be reſolved.</p>
               <p>For ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaid before, that the fall of the Iewes was the ſalvation of the Gentiles; and now that the ruine and diminution of the Iewes, the riches of the world. 1. God may ſeeme to deale hardly, in caſting off his owne people to receive ſtrangers; and beſides, it ſeemes contrarie to the rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Evill must not be done, that good may come of it.</hi> Whereto I anſwer, that it were hard, that God ſhould caſt off ſome to receive others. 1. If they were caſt off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their owne fault. 2. If the Lord were tied by bond not to caſt them off. 3. If their caſting off did not tend to their further good; But everie one of theſe will acquit God both from injuſtice and hard dealing. For 1. The Lord did not caſt them off, but for their unbeleefe, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. So
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18580:136"/>that they indeed caſt off themſelves. 2. God is not bound either to beſtow or continue his grace, he may conferre it and withdraw it upon whom, and from whom he will. If hee deny grace, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita redditur poena damnato; A due puniſhment is given to the damned;</hi> If he give grace, <hi>Indebita redditur gratia liberato; Vndeſerved grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him that is freed;</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>

That it beſeemes not Chriſtians, one to envie the happineſſe and ſalvation of another, but to be glad and rejoyce in it. But I come to particulars. 1.

                  </gap>, their caſting off; and being in ſenſe the ſame with the precedent clauſe, I note from the iteration: That the fall of the Iewes is diligently to bee obſerved and noted by us Gentiles: for that is a doctrine of weight, full of profit, and hath in it many leſſons of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall uſe. 1. That no nation, be they people never ſo deare, ſo graced with bleſſings, ſo beloved of God; but ſinne will ſet God and them at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and hazard the ruine both of their ſtate and government: That Common wealths and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes have their periods; Let Sparta, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and Nineveh witneſſe. 2. We learne that when the Word and Goſpell is become a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, the fall of that people is not far off, as in verſ. 12.3. Infidelitie and contempt of the Goſpell makes God in juſtice take it quite away from them, as verſ. 12.

               <p>The parts of his ſpeech are two. 1. How God

And ſo I come from the direction of his ſpeech to the parts of it. And, 1. how God graced him with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie &amp; Apoſtleſhip. The word is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in an equivocall &amp; improper ſenſe, and that is ſometime in the better ſenſe; as <hi>Andronicus</hi> &amp; <hi>Iunia</hi> are ſaid to be notable among the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. <hi>viz.</hi> in a large ſignification; as <hi>Titus</hi> &amp; others are Embaſſadors or Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. Sometimes the word is uſed univocally, and properly, and that either in a kinde of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as Chriſt is called our High Prieſt and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. Or elſe it is applyed to the chieſe Miniſters of the new Teſtament, which were properly called Apoſtles. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> makes foure kinds of Apoſtles: 1. Some were ordained onely by God, as <hi>Iſay, Ieremie,</hi> and the Prophets. 2. Some ordained of God, but by men, as <hi>Moſes</hi> conſecrated <hi>Aaron</hi> to be High Prieſt, and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to ſucceed him. 3. Some are ſent by men, and not of God, which are thruſt into the Miniſterie by letters, corruptions, bribes. 4. Some ſhoulder in themſelves, being appointed neither by God nor men: Sometimes the word ſignifies any one that is ſent, generally and properly the higheſt office, and dignitie of the Apoſtles in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſometimes it ſignifies thoſe that were ordained of Chriſt to be of equall authoritie with the 12. Apoſtles, ſuch as were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:18580:144"/>
               <p>The grace and excellencie of an Apoſtleſhip conſiſts eſpecially in theſe points. 1. They were immediately called by Chriſt to preach his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell thorow the world; <hi>Goe teach all Nations, Matth.</hi> 28. And it is no ſmall credit to bee Gods Herauld at armes, to be <hi>Tuba Evangelica,</hi> Gods Trumpet, both to give warning of a fight, and to ſound the retreat, to proclaime peace, and reſt when the combat is done; to deliver Gods will, to ſtand in his roome, to plead his cauſe and ſpeak for his honour, can bee no meane or ſmall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. 2. The Apoſtles were ſuch men as had knowen Chriſt in the fleſh, were eye-witneſſes of his miracles, and heard his Sermons, as in 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>That which we have heard and ſeene, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare we unto you;</hi> His glorie that they ſaw, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17. Secondly, his reſurrection, <hi>for he appeared to the twelve,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. His aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>while they beheld hee was taken up, Acts</hi> 1.9. And though S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not knowen Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, yet he ſaw him being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and in glorie by revelation, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Lyranus</hi> affirme on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Thirdly, they could diſcerne canonicall bookes of Scripture from others, they had the keyes of the Kingdome after a more ſpeciall manner, that <hi>whatſoever they bound in earth ſhould be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Peter</hi> bound up the ſinne of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and pronounced ſentence againſt <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> Fourthly, they had power to worke miracles, heale diſeaſes, caſt out Devils, yea <hi>Peters</hi> verie ſhadow, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.15. and <hi>Pauls</hi> napkin, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.12.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18580:145"/>Fifthly, they gave the Holy Ghoſt by laying on of their hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. They were free from error in doctrine, for the Spirit promiſed to lead them into all truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.13. Laſtly, they had the gifts of tongues, whereto <hi>Pererius</hi> addes further, that they had another ſpeciall grace, that ſpeaking in their owne tongue, yet men of divers langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges did ſo underſtand them, as if they had ſpoken divers languages; and of the ſame opinion is <hi>Eraſmus Annot. in Act.</hi> 2.8.

               <p>Here I ſhould firſt lay downe the duties of good Miniſters, how they ought to live and preach, that ſo they may magnifie their offices. Secondly, the lamentable face of our Church, in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18580:147"/>reſpect that ſo many of her children, who ſhould be like <hi>Barnabas,</hi> prove like <hi>Benoni,</hi> a heavineſſ and woe unto her; how too many Miniſters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the miniſterie, and many that ſometimes doe preach the Goſpell, diſcredit the Goſpell; many that are ſcrued (as it were) into this office, are the great blemiſhes of it; ſometimes in doing ſomething elſe, ſometime in doing nothing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in doing evilly. But this is a point that is knowne well enough; I wiſh it were to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: I ſpare the handling of it in this audience: Tis a thing rather to be lamented, than preached and publiſhed; it is too well knowne in Gath, and publiſhed in the ſtreets of Askelon: I pray God we might live to ſee the day, that they who have authoritie would either reſorme, or root them out of the Church; that they who baniſh dead idols out of Church windowes, would not ſet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving idols in our pulpits: That they would not ſet them to ſpeake againſt drunkenneſſe, who be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots themſelves; againſt Laodicean luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who be hollow themſelves; them to pull downe ſinne in others, who hugge and dandle it themſelves. <hi>Theſe times need no ſuch aids and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.</hi> God hath no need of ſuch,<note place="margin">Nec talianxlio, nec defenſoribus eſtu, tempus egit.

               <p>THis is the ſecond argument to perſwade the Gentiles not to boaſt againſt the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Iewes, taken from the hope of their reſtoring: becauſe though caſt off, yet ſhall they be received againe; therefore boaſt not againſt them. The words ſeeme to containe two maine parts: The one, the fearefull and dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wherein the Iewes were; intimated in the laſt words, where they are compared to men that be <hi>dead.</hi> 2. The hope, that they ſhall come out of this death, and at laſt bee delivered from the danger, in theſe words, <hi>Their receiving ſhall bee life from the dead.</hi> Though a man be dead, there is hope to live againe; though a tree be withered, there is hope that when winter is paſt it may wex greene againe, Such is the eſtate of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>In briefe, the argument is taken from the leſſe to the greater, thus, If their caſting away were good, how much more their receiving; and ſo being an hypotheticall propoſition, it conſiſts of an antecedent and a ſequele. From the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I obſerve: That God never gives way to any evill, but for a good end and purpoſe: their
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18580:152"/>fall was ſuffered for this end, to reconcile the world unto himſelfe, as in the eleventh verſe.</p>
               <p>I come to the ſequele, wherein were noted, firſt their danger, <hi>dead;</hi> ſecondly, their hope, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to life from death.</hi> From the firſt note, <hi>That living in ſinne, out of favour with God,</hi>

                  <hi>is to be in the eſtate of a dead man. The dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God, Ioh.</hi> 5.25. If you aske who be theſe dead, ſurely you need not goe downe into the vaults of the earth to ſeeke them, they are buried above ground, they are dead ſoules in living bodies. That body is their tombe, and this their epitaph, <hi>Hic ſiti ſunt, Here are they buried.</hi> Therefore <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the dead, Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. It may be thought a ſtrange poſition, and ſavour ſomewhat of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that a man that breathes, and moves, and ſpeakes, and drinkes, and ſweares, and fights, and does all other acts which now adayes are counted manly, ſhould be induced, that for all this he is no better than a dead man, a carcaſe. But let ſuch a man as this be brought before the Iudge of life Chriſt Ieſus, examined by the rule of life, <hi>viz.</hi> the word, and you ſhall ſee what his caſe is. The life of a Chriſtian conſiſts in the union of his ſoule with God, which is made by the grace of the holy ſpirit dwelling in him; for as the life of the body is the ſoule, ſo the life of the ſoule is grace; and where that is wanting, well may the body live, but the ſoule is dead, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5. Such dead men are all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. yea
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18580:153"/>dead even from the wombe, and (if I may ſo ſpeake) ſtill borne; for no man brought grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, nor ſuckt it from his mother; he is made, not borne a Chriſtian. The word <hi>Soule</hi> is capable of life, if God be pleaſed to give it: the beſt by nature, but dead. There be two things that argue life in the ſoule of man; ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if man in the eſtate of ſinne hath either, I will confeſſe him to be alive, and not dead. But firſt, he hath no ſenſe, for <hi>he perceives not the things of the ſpirit of God, nor can he, for they are diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpiritually,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Secondly, he hath no motion, he hath ſet up his reſt in this world, never dreames of aſpiring higher. Tell him of a journey to heaven, tis not in him to will it, tis not in him once to thinke of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Now if this man may be ſaid to live, which manifeſts life neither by ſenſe nor motion, then ſtocks and ſtones, and the dulleſt of spring of the elements may as truly be ſaid to live. So that wee may conclude, as Chriſt doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Let the dead bury their dead;</hi> or I may ſay of ſuch, as the holy Ghoſt doth of the Angell of the Church of Sardis, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, but thou art dead.</hi>

               <p>IT is the confirmation of the ſecond argument, from the hope that the Iewes ſhall bee reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe an holy people ſhall not bee caſt off for ever: but the Iewes are hereditarily an holy people; therefore ſhall not bee caſt off for ever. Of this argument, the aſſumption, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor onely is expreſſed, and is amplified by two metaphors: the one from the holy firſt fruits, the other from the holy root; the one taken from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the other from the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was this, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.20. You ſhall offer a cake of the firſt of your corne; that was the firſt fruit, which being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and holy, the remnant was alſo holy; that is, was made good and wholeſome. The order of Nature is this; the juyce, and the ſap or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture comes firſt into the root, and then into the branches: So that if the ſap be good in the root, it is good alſo in the branches; now to apply, the firſt fruits were holy. The root whence the Iewes came was good, therefore they are good alſo. Who are theſe firſt fruits, and who this root is?

               <p>THis is the third reaſon, taken from the twofold condition of the Gentiles; the one ſhewing what they were in former time; the other, what now they are. They were branches of a wilde olive, now engrafted into the right olive tree. More particularly thus; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument conſiſts of an antecedent in the 17. verſe, and a conſequent in the 18. In the antecedent, I note, firſt the eſtate of the Iewes, which was like to a tree, whoſe branches be broken off in the beginning. Secondly, the double eſtate of the Gentiles; the firſt, they were like to a wilde olive tree, without the compaſſe and hedge which was about the Lords garden, as alſo void of all good fruit; the other what they are, <hi>engrafted into the right olive tree;</hi> where you may note, how God beſtowes upon the Gentiles a threefold grace and benefit: firſt, an engrafting into the right root; ſecondly, made partaker of the root; made of the ſame nature with the root; thirdly, made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the fatneſſe, that is, of all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and benefits of the covenant made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> I beginne firſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18580:161"/>of the Iewes, ſome of the bracnhes be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. Firſt, they were ſuch as thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves branches good enough, becauſe outwardly as faire and freth as any other. And from thence note. Wicked men ſeeke no further, than to have the outward privileges of Gods children. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no outward privilege can acquit a ſinful people from Gods anger, nor prove them to be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: either propoſition is before handled upon the firſt verſe of this Chapter. Secondly, they are but ſome of the branches whence note two points; firſt, none that are within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are broken off finally. Secondly, all the Iewes are not within the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſee likewiſe on the firſt verſe of the ſaid Chapter. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> Thirdly, <hi>They are broken off; God hath not ſo tied his promiſes and graces to any mans ſeed, but ſome of them may be caſt off, if they degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi> though God made the promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed, yet <hi>Iſhmael</hi> hath no right unto it; <hi>Caſt out the Bondwoman and her ſonne, for the ſonne of the Bondwoman ſhall not bee heire with my ſonne Iſaac, Gal.</hi> 4.30.

The Iewes ſay they came of <hi>Abram,</hi> and yet Chriſt hath cenſured them to be ſonnes of Satan, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.44. But this I meet hereafter; I proceed to the twofold eſtate of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, what they were; <hi>oleaſter, a wilde olive tree, quaſi olea ſterilis, a barren olive-tree.</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:18580:161"/>There be two kinds of olive trees that be barren; the one made, as <hi>Plinie</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Plin Nat. Hiſt. lib. <hi>17.</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> that if a goat doe but licke it, it preſently becomes barren, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bears olives more; the other naturally barren, and is here called the wilde olive, which hath the ſhape, the leafe, the bough of the true olive, but it wants the generous juyce, it wants the fruits. Such were the Gentiles, they had outwardly the ſame image and ſimilitude with the people of God, they had ſome morall vertues like unto leaves, outwardly reſembling the good workes of Gods children, but wanting that generous juyce, that is, the graces of Gods ſpirit, without which there is nothing that God accepts.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18580:169"/>to receive a bleſſing at ones hands, and crow over him that gave it: but if the Gentiles inſult over the Iewes, then the branches rejoyce over the tree that beares them, the hands againſt the body that ſuſtaines them, the chariot againſt the wheeles whereon it is borne, and the roofe of the houſe againſt the pillars whereon it ſtands. But the concluſion which may be inferred is firſt in the poſition. How much men are beholding to their holy anceſtors, and children to be borne of holy parents, they are holy for the promiſe made unto their fathers, as in verſe 16.</p>

And to have beene enlightned, and taſted of the good Word of God; that is, to have attained to ſome knowledge in the myſterie of the Word, and the powers of the world to come; by world to come, wee muſt underſtand the Church of the New Teſtament; and by powers the doing of miracles; which Chriſt in the primitive times granted both to the elect and reprobate. I paſſe a multitude of places, and their reaſon from the Angels and <hi>Adam,</hi> who were juſt and yet fell.

                  <hi>Adam</hi> fell, but not finally; the Angels were reprobates, therefore fell finally; we elect and within the Covenant, and therefore cannot fall finally; but I cannot in this Audience ſpeake, as beſeemes this queſtion, onely for concluſion I wiſh you to admire the happy eſtate &amp; condition of all that truly feare God, and faithfully beleeve in his holy name, as verſ. 1.

               <p>The reaſons of this are, firſt, becauſe their ſinnes have a proportion with ours, therefore our puniſhment muſt bee like to theirs. Wee may reade in Sodome, what our owne ſinnes are, pride, idleneſſe, fulneſſe of bread. We may reade in Iſrael what our owne lives are; unbeleeving hearts to depend upon Gods providence, ready to murmure if we want any thing, ſtill unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full though wee have never ſo much. Wee may reade in <hi>Adam</hi> how ſubject we are to yeeld unto Satan: In <hi>David,</hi> how ready to yeeld to our owne fleſh: In <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> how eaſily we grow proud, and when wee ſee their ſinnes like ours, then we may well thinke, that our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be like to theirs. If our ſins be pride, and fulneſſe of bread, and idleneſſe, then take heed our puniſhment be not ſire and brimſtone: If infidelity and unthankfulneſſe, take heed of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18580:190"/>excluſion from Gods favour and love: If luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe, take heed of ſpuing out of his mouth: If Sabbath-breaking, take heed that God <hi>kindle not a ſire in the gates of your Citie, that will never be quenched,</hi> as <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is as much diſpleaſed with ſinne now, as in times paſt; his eyes are as wide to eſpie and marke it, his hand as juſt to revenge and cenſure it, his wrath is as heavie againſt it as ever it was, and therefore if wee would not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht as they have beene, beware of the ſinnes that they have done.

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Iudaeorum, Gods ſeveritie in cutting off the Iewes;</hi> thats one thing to keepe them in awe, and he gives it with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or bounty toward the undeſerving Gentile; it was not thy deſert, but his bountie: thats the next thing to keepe thee in awe, and draw thee to thankfulneſſe. The third is taken from the condition upon which they have this bountie, if they continue in his bountie, <hi>viz.</hi> in faith: for a good which is had upon condition, ſtirreth up in us a ſtudie to fulfill the condition. The fourth, from the commination of cutting off; <hi>If thou grow proud and revolt, thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> I begin with the firſt, Gods ſeveritie in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Iewes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God ſits his puniſhment both according to the greatneſſe and qualitie of mans ſinne.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> They caſt away him, he now cuts off them; they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a grievous ſinne, and he now overtakes them with a ſevere puniſhment. See the ſinne of the Church of Laodicea, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.16. her ſinne was luke-warmneſſe, a temper betweene hot and cold, which is to the ſtomacke moſt loath ſome and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive; and her puniſhment is ſutable, God ſpues her out of his mouth; and as ſhe by luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe was offenſive, ſo now ſhe being vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited up, is become an offence to others, that they loath her. If the ſinne be great, he ſuits it with a grievous puniſhment, as he did with Iſrael,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:18580:193"/>when for a foule ſinne, and of long continuance, he ſent ſore plagues, and of long durance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.59. If the ſinne be of any ſtrange qualitie, he ſuits it with a puniſhment anſwerable; as he did with Sodome; ſhee ſinned by burning in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſt, and he puniſhes her by burning her with a ſhowre of brimſtone; the ſtinke of her ſinne came up to Heaven; and he puniſhes her by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her into a ſtinking fen,<note place="margin">Carion. Chron. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> an Aſphaltite lake, and a dead ſea. If the ſinne be grievous, he payes it with a grievous puniſhment; as hee doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane actions with uncleane diſeaſes, backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in hearing him, with utter refuſall to heare them, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>But the point whereat the Apoſtle principally aimes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> is this. That whatſoever wee ſee God to puniſh in another, we ſhould beware of it in our ſelves: Therefore muſt the Gentile take notice of the ſeveritie ſhewed to the Iew; that hee may bee kept from that ſinne, for which the Iew was caſt off. If God puniſh idolatrie in Iſrael, it is to weane the hearts of his people from it: If mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, it is to teach us the Apoſtles leſſon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11. and that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. If hee puniſh <hi>Cain,</hi> by ſetting upon him a marke, it is to teach us to keepe our hands free from bloud; if <hi>Dives,</hi> it is to keepe us free from covetouſneſſe; if hee ſet a fire in the gates of Ieruſalem for breaking the Sabbath, it is to teach us to keepe it holy, and take a delight to make it glorious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. If hee puniſh adulterie, it is to teach us to keepe our bodies chaſte and pure, as ſweet and fit
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:18580:193"/>temples for his Spirit to dwell and tarrie in.</p>
               <p>The Vſe is: To condemne us for doing that our ſelves, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> which wee ſee God to puniſh in other men: If God be ſomewhat ſlacke, and loth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, as hee hath done others, his patience ſhould lead us to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. make thee better, not worſe. <hi>Vide ſeveritatem,</hi> Marke the ſeveritie of God to other ſinner; and the ſame that payes other men their deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will pay thee, without ſpeedy and ſound repentance: But theſe be points that are neere of kindred to thoſe I have already handled: and therefore I come ſuddenly to the conſideration of his bountie to the Gentiles.</p>

                  <hi>The generous minde of man is more eaſily led than drawen,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca:</hi> The heart of man that is ſanctified, is more wrought upon by love and kindneſſe, than by judgements and threats: Slaves and ſervants obey for feare; but ſonnes and children for love and kindneſſe: excellent is that Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Doe yee ſo reward the Lord, O fooliſh people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe?</hi> thou ſhouldeſt have conſidered, that hee hath beene unto thee as a father, that hee hath made and proportioned thee; how he led thee in the wilderneſſe, taught thee, and kept thee as the apple of his eyes, &amp; as the Eagle ſtirreth up, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is this: When men abſtaine from ſin, becauſe God hath loved them, then God continues his mercie and loving kindneſſe: But when love and kindneſſe cannot make them love God againe, then God takes his mercie away from them. <hi>They that loue thee and thy Law, ſhall have great proſperitie, and ſhall feele no hurt, Pſal.</hi> 119.165.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18580:195"/>ſtill they continue to ſinne againſt him: then God upbraids them with the gifts hee hath given them, ceaſeth to doe them good, and removes his bleſſings from them. Hee made Iſrael fat and groſſe, and laded them with fatneſſe; But when they regarded it not; then the Lord was angrie, and ſaid, <hi>I will hide my face away from them, Deut.</hi> 32.19, 20.</p>

Remember how at the firſt he created us men, and not beaſts and vile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Laertius</hi> reports of <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> that he was uſed to account himſelfe much beholding to God for three things. 1.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18580:196"/>their dutie, to keepe them from ſecuritie. Now upon this premiſe, if thou continue not, <hi>thou ſhalt be cut off,</hi> neither of theſe concluſions will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Therefore ſome of the elect doe not abide, but are cut off: nor this, if they cannot be cut off, therefore the commination is in vaine. For firſt, theſe comminations are againſt the whole body of the Gentiles: But not againſt everie particular of them; for many times the whole body of a Church may bee caſt off for infidelitie, and yet everie particular not caſt off: The ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Aſia caſt off, yet none of the elect amongſt them are periſhed: The Church of the Iewes caſt off, yet <hi>Paul</hi> periſhed not. Secondly, in the whole body of everie Church there bee evill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the good, hypocrites amongſt beleevers: In both then there is uſe both of exhortation and threatning.

                  <hi>than want of faith, to beleeve the Goſpell when it is preached;</hi> as verſ. 11. Secondly, Infidelitie cuts man from God, and makes a ſeparation betweene them, as verſ. 20. Thirdly, it is expedient and
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18580:196"/>neceſſarie for Miniſters in a time of generall ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and corruption of manners; when they ſee their people to reſt in titles and outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, to uſe arguments of terror, &amp; lay open the heavieſt judgments of God that hang over them. So doth the Apoſtle againſt thoſe that often heare, but profit nothing; that receive the dew, and the former and latter raine, he threatens bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. So doth the Prophet for thoſe three privative ſinnes, want of mercie, truth, and knowledge; and thoſe five poſitive.

               <p>
                  <hi>In part]</hi> There is no queſtion but this was the greater part, onely a ſmall remnant that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as verſ. 5. Even ſo at this sime there is a remnant. Though the people of the world be many, yet they that belong to God are not many, as verſ. 5. And ſo I come to the ſecond branch of the myſterie:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vntill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.]</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> The Apoſtle taught them before, that the hardneſſe of the Iewes ſhould come to an end; here he ſets downe the time when it ſhall be, <hi>untill the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles ſhall come in.</hi> By this fulneſſe is meant Gods Church gathered, out of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the preaching of the Goſpell; not that all Nations ſhall bee converted: for then the Church ſhould have no enemies, nor ſhould there be any truth in theſe Prophecies of the Apoſtaſie of Antichriſt, and the ſmall number of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the laſt times. But this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies the turning of great multitudes of all Nations to the faith of Chriſt; ſuch as hath not beene of old, no not in the time &amp; at the preaching of the Apoſtles. I omit that doubt and queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall be ſo come in, that after the converſion of the Iew, no more Gentiles ſhall bee called; for I beleeve, that to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18580:210"/>the end the Word ſhall worke upon the Gentile, as well as on the Iew: I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of it in his proper place. In this branch of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie obſerve, firſt, the period of the miſeries of the Iewes; ſecondly, the complement of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles, the one noted at the word <gap reason="foreign">

In the former, which I call the period of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Iewes, I note firſt, that there is no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo farre gone in ſinne, but when they returne God will receive them, as verſ. 23. Secondly, though obſtinacie lye upon them verie long, yet before the end of the world they ſhall be called againe. The reaſons: 1. The firſt fruits of the Iewes converted, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, old <hi>Simeon,</hi> and the Apoſtles; and here and there ſome in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, <hi>Egiſippus,</hi> the writer of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, a Iew. <hi>Bucolcerus,</hi> about the yeere 162. in the time of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour: and the Magdeburgenſes report of one in Spaine,<note place="margin">Cent. <hi>13.</hi>

From the drift and project of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this Chapter: But this point meets mee in the next verſe, onely let us make this uſe, as verſ. 11. 2.

               <p>I come to the complement of the felicity of the Gentiles, their fulneſſe is come in:<note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> By ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> he meanes not every particular Gentile, but the Nations in generall; nor is it to be underſtood of an univerſall enlightning of the whole world at the time of the Iewes converſion; for in the Apoſtles time the word was generally preached unto all the unknowne and inhabited Nations of the world; as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The word of truth, which is the Goſpell, as come unto you, even as it is to all the world:</hi> and it is preached to <hi>every creature,</hi> verſ. 23. Now that the Goſpell ſhould the ſecond time bee publiſht and divulged over the world, we have neither Scripture nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for it. For firſt, Apoſtolicall gifts and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, moſt neceſſary for ſo great a work, are ceaſed many hundred yeares ſince. Secondly, at Chriſts comming there ſhall be almoſt <hi>no faith,</hi> that is, ſound doctrine and zeale, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 28.8. <hi>When the ſonne of man commeth ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> and yet his comming will be ſhortly after the calling of the Iewes. Thirdly, it may be that the Goſpell ſhall be revived in many kingdomes where it was planted before, in and neere thoſe places where the Iewes ſhall bee after their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall calling, but ſhall not be generall. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18580:211"/>that looke for an univerſall preaching, may ſooner ſee Chriſt comming the clouds of heaven. So that I ſay by fulneſſe is meant a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as <hi>Calvin;</hi> or the nations in general, as <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt point is the effect of the Goſpell: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>Be it never ſo much oppoſed, it ſhall convert in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the full number that belongs unto God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it the power of God to every one that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>It ſhall proſper in that for which I ſend it, and not returne void, Iſay</hi> 55.11. By it wee muſt be ſaved if wee belong unto him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2. and as it was in the Apoſtles time, the word was oppoſed, and ſtill it proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; trodden downe, and ſtill it grew; though the ſower were martyred, yet the Goſpell ſtill tooke root, and ſpread it ſelfe to the end of the world: So now, be it never ſo much envied, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and hindered, it ſhall gather the elect from the foure winds, and be preached til all the Lords flocke be gathered, and turned unto the Lord.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> how fearfull a caſe it is to be deprived of the Goſpell: it is to be feared that in ſuch places the Goſpell hath had his full wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and that where it remaines not, God hath already gathered his wheat, and the remainder are but tares and chaffe. Secondly, that where it is preached plentifully, there the Lord hath as yet a great harveſt, and many of his elect as yet to be gathered. <label type="milestone">

I doe conceive that the myſterie in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is in this point. Whether the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles ſhall be ſuch, that after the calling of the Iewes no moe Gentiles ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; becauſe he ſaid that their fulneſſe is come in already. I doe well remember the rule of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine; Faithfull ignorance is better than raſh know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>

                  </note> And though it may ſeeme, that before the converſion of the Iewes, the Gentiles fulneſſe ſhall be ſo great, and after their converſion the time ſo ſhort, that therefore there ſhall be no more converting of any moe Gentiles; yet is it not unlikely, that even after the calling of the Iew, ſome Gentiles may be converted. Firſt, ſome ſhall be converted at the eleventh houre, as it is in the parable in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. not only at the end of life, but at the end of the world there will be ſome wiſe virgins with oile in their lamps, ſome corners of good ground that will receive the good ſeed thats caſt into it. Secondly, after the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Iewes, there ſhall be better meanes to convert the Gentiles than ever before: Firſt, more cleare underſtanding of the Scriptures: ſecondly, ſuch zeale and practice of holineſſe in the Iewes, as cannot chuſe but provoke many Gentiles to follow them.<note place="margin">Melto efficacior eſt vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, even after the converſion of the Iew; yea, at the end of the world God ſhall finde ſome of his owne among the Gentiles alive, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.15. in likely hood converted after the comming of the Iewes: But in this ſecret myſterie I am not acquainted; I deliver nothing for certaine, I doe not deſire to be of Gods Counſell, it is enough to bee of his Court.

               <p>THis is the third branch of the myſterie, wherein the Apoſtle points at two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the converſion of the Iewes. The one, the time, at the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the number, <hi>All Iſrael;</hi> for the former, the Scripture hath determined that it ſhall be; but of the day, and yeare it hath ſaid nothing; all that I dare ſay of it, is by way of probabilitie, and it may be comprized in theſe propoſitions. 1. The converſion of the Iewes is not as yet paſt; for
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18580:212"/>though ſome be here and there converted, yet the promiſe being more generall is not yet fulfilled. 2. The ſtumbling blocke which hinders their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion muſt firſt be taken away; Babylon muſt firſt be deſtroyed and burnt, as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.20. For in Babylon they ſee ſome ſacrifice to Idols, ſome proſtrate themſelves before creatures, and ſuch horrible wickedneſſe, and by them they judge of us all, that till this Babylon be deſtroyed, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Iewes can hardly bee expected.

                  <hi>but univerſally all:</hi> So <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Cajetane</hi> in their Commentaries. Some preſcribe the meanes how this whole Nation ſhall be converted, to wit, by the preaching of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> as <hi>Gregorie, Theodoret, Lyranus, Anſelmus,</hi> and divers others upon this Text, which is but a fancie, for <hi>Elias</hi> is come already: for that <hi>Elias</hi> which <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith muſt come, Chap. 4.5. our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds of <hi>Iohn Baptist.

My judgement is; That toward the end of the world, before the comming of Chriſt, the Iewiſh Nation ſhall bee converted, yet everie one of that Nation I dare not ſay: for firſt, the teſtimonies which <hi>Paul</hi> cites out of <hi>Iſay,</hi> muſt not be underſtood of ſome particulars, but of a great number, ungodlineſſe ſhall bee turned away from <hi>Iacob.</hi> And S. <hi>Origen</hi> fitly alleageth that prophecie, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18580:214"/>and is by <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expounded of the generall converſion of the Iewes. Thirdly, <hi>Beza</hi> in his Annotations ſhewes, that all Iſrael which muſt be ſaved, is an oppoſition to thoſe that are hardened, and thoſe were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, their abundance: ſo that great multitudes of them ſhall be converted. Fourthly, of all ancient people that have beene from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, onely the Iewes doe yet remaine in ſo divers caſualties, in captivitie, in diſperſion, diſtinct from all others where they dwell in manners &amp; religion; which out of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a demonſtrative reaſon, that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them for ſome ſpeciall purpoſe above all others.

               <p>THeſe verſes containe a third argument to prove the laſt branch and clauſe of the myſterie,<note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> to wit, that God will call home
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:18580:236"/>the nation of the Iewes; and a perſwaſion to the Gentile not to deſpaire and doubt of it. It is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall reaſon taken <hi>a comparatis,</hi> from the greater to the leſſe. If the infidelitie of the Iewes was the occaſion of ſhewing mercy to the Gentiles, much more ſhall the mercy ſhewed to the Gentiles oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the ſhewing of mercy to the Iewes; for will not God take occaſion to doe good from good as ſoone as from evill? If infidelitie in the Iewes make God ſhew favour to the Gentile, much more ſhall his mercy ſhewed formerly to the Gentile, make him alſo now ſhew mercy to the Iew. The things compared are three: Firſt, the infidelitie of the Gentile with the infidelitie of the Iew; Secondly, the mercy which the Gentile received in time paſt, with the mercy which the Iew ſhall receive hereafter; Thirdly, the occaſion of both. The occaſion of mercy to the Gentile, infidelitie in the Iew; the occaſion of mercy to the Iew, is mercy formerly extended to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. I begin with the firſt branch of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Yee in time paſt have not beleeved:</hi> as if he had ſaid; Learne from your ſelves, that yee ought not to deſpaire of the Iewes. They are now in the verie ſame caſe wherein thou waſt once; They in unbeleefe, ſo waſt thou; ſtrangers from God, ſo waſt thou: Therefore ſeeing thou art n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> favour as thou haſt, and be received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as thou haſt beene. There be two things that the Apoſtle would have us learne.</p>
               <p>The firſt: That the conſideration of what the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:18580:237"/>Gentiles once were, ſhould reſtraine them from being proud of the happineſſe wherein now they are; as verſ. 17.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>If a man would conſider himſelfe, he would not judge hardly, nor deſpaire utterly of his brethren.</hi> It is the rule of the Apoſtle; <hi>If a man be fallen by occaſion into any fault, yee which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall reſtore ſuch an one with the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſidering thy ſelfe: Gal.</hi> 6.1. Our Saviour, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.5. bids us conſider <hi>the beames that are in our owne eyes,</hi> and then wee cannot doubt, but the moats may be taken out of our brothers eye: for as we helpe up thoſe that be fallen, we releeve the diſtreſſed, we pitie the afflicted, we burie the dead; becauſe wee conſider our ſelves in them, and their caſe may bee ours: So are wee to judge meekly of thoſe that have fallen, becauſe we may fall and be overtaken as well as they: Who will doubt of quenching the fire in his neighbours houſe, who hath ſeene as great a flame quencht in the thatch of his owne houſe? or deſpaire of the returne of his brother, who conſiders that hee himſelfe was once a prodigall, who had run away from his father, and ſpent his portion in riotous living? The ſame gate of mercie is open to thy brother, that was opened to thee; The ſame God ſtands waiting to receive him, who formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thee: If a brother bee not called to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet hee that conſiders that it was once his owne caſe, will be loth to judge him: If he be in a dangerous eſtate and courſe, yet he that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that himſelfe was once an heire and childe of
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:18580:237"/>wrath, will bee loth to diſpaire of him.</p>
               <p>From whence we may ſee the ground and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſome fall to ſuch a raſh cenſuring of their brethren; becauſe they conſider not themſelves, they remember not what once they were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are like thoſe <hi>Lamiae,</hi> or Witches, who ſet their eyes into their heads when they goe abroad, and put them into a box when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home. They cenſure <hi>Davids</hi> adulterie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conſider not, that they were once like <hi>Clodius</hi> themſelves; they deſpaire of <hi>Abſalom</hi> for his conſpiracie, becauſe they have forgotten that they were once as bad as <hi>Cateline</hi> themſelves. Let us caſt eye upon our ſelves: we have been in the ſnare, and now we are delivered, hope well of others: we have beene ſonnes of wrath, but wee are ſanctified, hope the beſt of others: overtaken with many ſins, but now we have ſhaken them off, deſpaire not of others: no man is worſe now than thou waſt once, <hi>a childe of wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>dead in treſpaſſes, Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>without Chriſt, aliants from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from Covenant of promiſe, had no hope without God in the world, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Conſider this in thy ſelfe, and deſpaire not of others: And ſo I come to the firſt point of the compariſon, wherein wee muſt conſider: 1. The condition wherein the Gentile once was; <hi>He beleeved not.</hi> 2. The eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in now he is; <hi>he hath obtained mercie.</hi> 3. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mercie to the Gentile, the unbeleefe of the Iew; <hi>through their unbeleefe.</hi> For the firſt. When the Apoſtle would ſhew the miſerable

               <p>

I finde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point foure ſeverall opinions: Some have thought Gods ſaving grace to bee ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that it reacht unto all, both men and Devils, which errour is aſcribed unto <hi>Origen,</hi> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed at large by S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. <hi>10.21.</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi> ad <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> Some have hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that God ordained grace and mercie for all, and was not in any ſenſe the cauſe of mans repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; this was the old hereſie of the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and is not without her well-willers at this day. The third is of the Papiſts, who deny not that reprobation doth proceed in ſome ſenſe from the decree and will of God: But that it is Gods act ſo formally and ſo properly as election is. The fourth only is according to godlineſſe; That pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is both of the elect to ſalvation, &amp; all reprobates to damnation. I will not waken the firſt, which is the dead error of <hi>Origen,</hi> I will deale only with the Papiſt and the Pelagian, who are Iebuſites yet alive in the Canaan of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Rhemiſts poſition on <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Annot.</hi> 5. on verſ. 17. is this, God intends no mans damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly, and abſolutely, but in reſpect of their demerits, and it is their marginall note upon verſ. 22. That God is not the cauſe of any mans
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:18580:244"/>damnation, or reprobation, otherwiſe than for the puniſhment of his ſinnes: of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who maketh God the Author of reprobation farre otherwiſe than of election, and excludes it out of the definition of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.<note place="margin">De grat. &amp; lib. arbit. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> Their arguments are taken from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God would have all men to bee ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> The 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>God would have no man to periſh; but would have all come to repentance.</hi> The 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. <hi>God will not the death of a ſinner.</hi> Therefore the death and condemnation of man ſtands not properly with the will of God. To which it may briefly be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus: Firſt, God is ſaid not to will the death of a ſinner, not becauſe in his ſecret will he hath not decreed it; but becauſe God in mans condemnation hath reſpect to his owne glorie: that is it which principally hee wills, both in his election and reprobation: that which God chiefly and principally wils, is his glory, and this glory is gotten by electing of ſome out of the maſſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and leaving of others. Secondly, God will have all ſaved, that is, <hi>de generibus fingulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> all kindes of people:<note place="margin">Euchir. cap. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note> it is <hi>Auguſtines</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Thirdly, Gods will is, that all the elect ſhall be ſaved: as we ſay, all goe in at the doore of the houſe, not becauſe all men goe into that houſe, but becauſe all that goe into the houſe, goe that way. Fourthly, All, in regard of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, not in reſpect of efficiencie; in regard of the worthineſſe of the price, not in regard of the propertie of redemption, God wils with the will
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18580:244"/>of his ſigne, not of his decree, that is, of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not of his good pleaſure. Fifthly, in regard of his revealed will, who offereth unto all the outward means of ſalvation, not with the will of his good pleaſure and decree. The Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in briefe are theſe: 1. God as hee hath made all men, ſo hee hath freely diſpoſed of their end, according to the counſell of his owne will, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome to be veſſels of honour, ſome veſſels of wrath. And this is moſt juſt, to ſave ſome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject others, whereas he might condemne all:<note place="margin">Nemo injuſtitia Deum arguat, ſi uni indebitum donaverit gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, alteri debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam reddiderit poenam.

                  <hi>Let no man accuſe God of injuſtice, if hee ſhall give to one undeſerved grace, ſhall render to another deſerved puniſhment:</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> 2. Nothing muſt make us thinke, that God condemnes any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their owne fault; hee ordaines none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which they have not juſtly deſerved by their ſin, and that God only hath decreed and willed their puniſhment, but not the ſinne that brings them to it: If now you demand whether this reprobation depend only upon Gods abſolute will, or there were in it a reſpect &amp; view of mans ſin; I have diſcuſſed this before, when I handled the ſecond verſe of this Chapter. And ſo I come from the Papiſt to his brother the Pelagian, and others begotten of them both. It was the tenent of <hi>Pelagius:</hi> That the grace of God was not only in reſpect of the outward meanes generally offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all; but in Gods eternall decree and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ordained for all, if they would receive it: and <hi>Th. Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeeme to confute the opinion, yet in other words they affirme as much.

                  <hi>Iewes, Heathens, for that bloud was ſhed for all:</hi> in his anſwer to the argument of <hi>Luther.</hi> I have obſerved three ſeverall opinions: The firſt, that Chriſt without difference died for the ſinnes of all men, without any reſpect of faith, or infidelitie; yet all are not ſaved, becauſe ſome deſpiſe this grace offered, and ſo are deprived of the reconciliation purchaſed by Chriſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that all are ſaved by grace, and have faith in Chriſt. The third, that it is the purpoſe of God to ſave all, but the condition being kept, if they beleeve. The firſt applying Chriſts death to all, as well beleevers as unbeleevers, impugnes that Scripture, <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. The ſecond, making faith a naturall gift, is contrarie to the word; for that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is common to all; <hi>But all men have not faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. The third, aſcribing power to mans will, to receive and apprehend grace when it is offered, gaine ſayes that Scripture which ſaith, <hi>Without me yee can doe nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5. My pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to diſpute againſt all theſe in that point wherein they all agree, concerning univerſalitie of grace, the condition being kept. For order, I ſhall firſt lay downe my propoſition. Secondly, the confirmation from Scripture. Thirdly, ſhew the abſurd conſequents of the adverſe opinion. My propoſition is this: Whereas all men were by nature children of wrath, and in themſelves loſt; God, according to his good pleaſure, out
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:18580:245"/>of the whole maſſe elected ſome, to whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Ieſus Chriſt to be their Mediatour and Redeemer: to prove this the Scriptures are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.

Secondly, <hi>Christ died onely for his friends, Ioh.</hi> 15.13. But the elect onely, and ſuch as ſhall bee ſaved are his friend. Thirdly, the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. That <hi>Chriſt gave himſelfe for his Church, that hee might ſanctifie it:</hi> and that <hi>he is the Saviour of his bodie,</hi> verſ. 23.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt died onely for thoſe that are appointed to ſalvation; for the death of Chriſt is the ſubordinate meanes, which God uſeth to ſave thoſe whom hee would have ſaved: But all men in the world are nor appointed to ſalvation. It will bee anſwered: That it is Gods will that all ſhould bee ſaved upon this condition, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: So then if it can bee evicted, that Gods election unto life is not conditional, but abſolute, in ſetting apart a certaine number, to whom only he will give power and grace to beleeve, and to none other; then will the Concluſion be good; That for the number onely Chriſt hath died.</p>
               <p>The firſt place ſhall be, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Therefore though the outward meanes bee offered unto many, yet onely ſome are elected and choſen unto life. To this ſome have anſwered: That there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold election; Generall, of all who are called to the outward profeſſion of obedience; Speciall, of thoſe who obey their calling, and perſevere in faith to the end: So they make the meaning this: That few are elected, not in reſpect of any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſeparation in the decree of God: But
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:18580:246"/>becauſe among many, ſome onely perſevere unto the end. To this I anſwer: 1. There can bee no ſuch generall election; for what election, where all are received? 2. To ſay many are choſen, where Chriſt ſaith but few are choſen, what is this? 3. To the point: If that ſpeciall election depend upon mans perſeverance, and not mans perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon election: If men bee elect, becauſe they perſevere; and not rather perſevere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are elect; then are men cauſes of their owne election, and chuſe God firſt, contrarie to that rule of Chriſt; <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, Ioh.</hi> 15.16. Contrarie to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; <hi>We loved not God, but God loved us first,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. Contrarie to that of S. <hi>Paul, Who hath ſeparated thee?</hi> but God who ſeparates and diſtinguiſhes one from another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.23. <hi>The Kingdome</hi> of God ſhall be given unto them, for whom it <hi>is prepared of my Father.</hi> Therefore it is not prepared for all: and to ſtrengthen this Concluſion, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that <hi>ſome bee veſſels of wrath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſtruction: Rom.</hi> 9.22. To this they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: That theſe places prove not any particular exception of ſome from glorie, but that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is indifferently prepared for all that ſhall beleeve; and they that beleeve not, are by their incredulitie prepared to deſtruction; whereunto this is my reply: Wee grant that none but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ordained to glorie; but wee make faith and beleeving an effect and conſequent of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preparation unto glorie: So that the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:18580:247"/>number of beleevers is as certaine as the number of the elect: For I aske, whence is it that we have faith? <hi>It is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God: Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. If faith bee Gods gift, how is it that all have not faith? There is no reaſon, but becauſe God gives it not to all. And why doth not God give it unto all? But only becauſe God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſome, whom bee purpoſeth to ſave in Chriſt; and to theſe only is faith given. If it be ſaid, that God gives it to all, but all receive it not; then is Gods will reſiſted, and mans will fruſtrates the purpoſe of God; contrarie to that rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom</hi> 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> I come to the abſurdities that follow upon this.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Abſurdities that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low univerſall grace.</note> to affirme that Chriſt died univerſally for all that ſhould beleeve, and not for any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all number, takes away Gods predeſtination, makes it a confuſed and conditionall purpoſe; whereas the Scripture reacheth, that Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is certaine and definite; that hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and knoweth the number of the elect. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his? Ioh.</hi> 10.3. Chriſt calleth his ſheepe by name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it would follow, that election ſhould be from the fore-ſight of faith, contrarie to the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. who ſaith, <hi>That he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate them through Ieſus Chriſt unto himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:18580:247"/>of his office of redemption and mediation, was predeſtinate and preordained of God. And the ſame thing cannot bee both the cauſe and the object of predeſtination. Chriſt Ieus, as hee is the head with his body, which is the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the elect, are the object of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore not the cauſe: adde unto this. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>It is your Fathers pleaſure to give you the Kingdome.</hi> And if they firſt beleeved, they choſe him, he choſe not them; and the Lord pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it himſelfe of the children before they were borne: <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to affirme that God conditionally hath appointed all men, if they wil beleeve; and that it is his will that all ſhould beleeve, &amp; if all beleeve not, it is not for defect of grace, but through their owne fault, for God gives man free will &amp; power of himſelfe to beleeve, or not to beleeve, which is firſt againſt the rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:</hi> againſt the rule; <hi>It is not in him that willeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. againſt the rule; <hi>It is God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth both the will and the deed, Phil.</hi> 2.13. againſt the rule; <hi>Without me yee can doe nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5.</p>

His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 2. His ſpeeches. 3. His calling. His a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are of three kindes; naturall, civill, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

The Apoſtle hath mentioned two, whereof we ſhould be moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that wee diſhonour not God; to wit, eating and drinking.

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:18580:260"/>while the fleſh was yet betweene their teeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was chewed, Gods wrath was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33.

The Author of everie honeſt and lawfull calling is God: So the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>As God hath called everie man, ſo let him walke.</hi> The end of every lawfull calling is the common good; as members for the common good of the body, be it politicke, or naturall: Therefore many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they have lawfull callings when they have none; ſuch as live by uſurie, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, dicing, playing; theſe have neither the Author God, nor the end, the common good.

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:18580:260"/>which we undertake by natures guidance. Thirdly, hee that is fitted for many, muſt make choyce of the beſt; <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant, care not for it:</hi> that is, Though thy calling bee meane and hard; yet ſhake it not off, but beare it patiently, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. Fourthly, leave it not without good warrant; but I haſten to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. Let everie man examine his calling at the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Let everie man wherein he as called walke with God:</hi> No calling is lawfull, when the action pleaſeth not God, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. By this (I hope) ſome will learne at laſt to give over their calling, whereby they bring not honour, but diſhonour unto God: Thoſe that live upon uſurie, by dicing houſes, by penning and acting of playes, let them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, mine heart trembles to thinke, what calling theſe men have, my ſoule wonders how they glorifie God in them, I marvell how theſe make for a publike good; how God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, a kingdome bettered, the common good promoted by them; I know not, I beleeve not.
